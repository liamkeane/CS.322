Someone keeps asking me, "What's this movie about?" SS5+ is one of those that defies to be labeled...just the way I like it.<br /><br />Tadanobu Asano, a literal jack of all trades, is the main reason I wanted to see this. From an infamous masochist king known as Kakihara to low-key Kenji in the visually stunning Last Life in the Universe, Asano always manages to display, not only a wide range, but he performs on several different levels. In this one, you can't help feel anticipation for his scenes and trust me: they're worth the wait!!!You are then presented to an elegant buffet of avid brights, darks and color schemes which makes his home seem like Lewis Carroll's summer house. Reika Hashimoto and Asano (phenom chem!) had me mind scrapingly perplexed as to what would unfold next.<br /><br />The rest of the cast all play their roles well (and with fun) and the intertwining events keep the ball rolling with an occasional rest stop for character development and goodfeel. There's a dark humor in this film which gives it it an odd, adderol driven, yet refreshingly original style. Also, a high bpm soundtrack gives it some additional high octane for the trip. I will have to keep an eye out for Gen Sekiguchi's future films or other works by Taku Tada 'cause Survive Style 5+ has warped my way of thinking  in a good way!

I am not usually a big fan of experimental films but this movie is now one of my all time favorites. This movies has everything; action, comedy, horror, romance, philosophy... you name it. With 5 original and different stories to follow, even if you don't like one aspect of this film, another is sure to catch your fancy.<br /><br />Being a Japanese film this movie has the trademark Japanese type humor, so if you are into random comedy, you should enjoy this film. Even if thats not your style of humor I recommend you check out this movie just as a refreshing change from the typical Hollywood style<br /><br />Most important though, just have fun with this film; I have read reviews that try to analyze and put meaning to the different events of this film. Why do some people always need to find a moral to every story? I suppose there are ideas to be taken away from this movie, but don't try and analyze it too much, just enjoy it.

After viewing Apt Pupil the other night - and being sorely disappointed/distressed...I wanted to view a "lighter" movie. Well I must say this is one of my favorites now. I'm not one to remember every actor/actress name but the whole cast did a great job. I especially love the con with the computer - seeing as how I work in the IT Field - it was great! When you see the movie remember the very first scene. It is important because it is the reason for everything they do. And sometimes things work out...for the good.

Definitely one of my favorites!<br /><br />There are so many creative and innovative ideas and genuine rip-off's of clichés. A real fun to watch. And the stunning art style ... never seen a so detailed and thought-out flick like this one. Even when you watching this film a second time you still might get lost in figuring out all these details. <br /><br />Music was also perfectly used; a 100% match with the art style (something like Rock/Pop ...(?).. well, you'll get it when you see it) Even the slower and moderate background music (simple piano chords), which was used in the middle of the film for quite a long time, was also a consummate choice. <br /><br />The highlight, alongside the art style, of this movie was definitely characters and acting. Every one of them really stand out. Some of the reviews complained about a cliché-kind of presentation of Vinnie Jones. You know, this was intentionally; hinting at the cliché image of Gaikokujin (foreigners) in japan. It is just an amazing performance of the entire cast.<br /><br />If i happen to see this movie presented in an art exhibition, i wouldn't be surprised at all. A real masterpiece, though some might only like it, but not love it, as i do ... well, too bad! ;)

What is Survive Style 5+? One of the best films I have ever seen in my life. This film is about 5 ( or more, you decide) styles of living, depicted in a seemingly haphazard and bewildering form. The use of song, colors, cinematography will ensure most people have no excuse BUT to be captivated by every scene. Even those that simply miss out on all the symbolism and allegories for every day life will find this movie highly entertaining simply from the excellent performances and superb overall presentation.<br /><br />The movie opens up with a man, who's apparently murdered his wife, burying her in the forest with a couple of meaningful comments about murder itself. That serious moment opens up a floodgate of seemingly subconscious events and comedy that is meant to jar you from the underlying essence of the movie for a moment. The film introduces other "styles of life", for example a group of bumbling burglar teens, a hit-man (Vinnie Jones) and his translator, an advertising guru who thinks every think she makes is the pinnacle of hilarity, and a family that apparently has a few issues of their own to deal with.<br /><br />Each layer of bizarre is followed by another layer of bizarre, until the ending will most likely leave you with your jaw on the floor. The great thing about SS5+ is that deep within the layers of apparently non-sensical comedy and action, there is a meaning to unearth, most people will come up with their own ideas as to "what it all means" and THAT is the best aspect of SS5+, enjoy.

Just like Seal's 90's hit, "in a world full of people, there's always someone to fly". I would describe this movie as both an expression and example of the people who 'try to fly' - and they are usually considered crazy in society. They try different, previously unheard of things, and sometimes it's genius and sometimes it's a dud. But hey, at least they try.<br /><br />This movie is absurdingly complicated in a first viewing, yet it delivers with, yes, absolute style. On a second viewing the themes become more apparent, and this is a movie you'll want to see (at least) twice.<br /><br />Five stories are intertwined, sometimes subtly and others obviously, Tarantino/Ritchie mode, and they all deal with crazy stuff. This is a visual and stylish delight, as well as little bit of a mindtrip. There's symbolism if you look hard enough, but the joy of the movie is the way it deals with different themes - homosexuality, identity, love and death - and shows us that life is indeed a little bit crazy.<br /><br />Recommended. 8/10

Some people out there in may imagine the Japanese of Tokyo to be a stoic, colorless like the Vulcans. To some extent, that is how they really are. The buildings are gray, and if it's overcast, everything kind of blends together into a formalized drone. There is more paperwork added each day, another speech to sleep through, and the shuffle begins anew. Add the business formalities, and society can get very stiff over there.<br /><br />That is one side of Japan.<br /><br />SURVIVE STYLE 5 is the other side. Somewhere buried beneath the hard samurai exterior, the Japanese are the silliest, flashiest people on the face of the earth. Just watch the game shows on TV to see what I mean. It takes the slightest spark to transform a crowd of adults into a crowd of Pokemon monsters. Add this side of Japan, and every conversation at the workplace has a Comic Book BANG! POW! and HORRA!<br /><br />The movie features five story lines (1) A hip to be square family of four (2) A girl that won't stay buried (3) An assassin on a hit job (4) A hypnotist (5) A traveling band of fools in a van. Here's a puzzle for you -- what is the common element that connects these 5 story lines? Beats me. Maybe it's the STYLE.<br /><br />SURVIVE STYLE 5 is like a multi-colored salad falling to the kitchen floor in slow motion. Everyone stands agape as the orange leaves scatter like purple rain. Most memorable are the vivid colors and extreme silliness. Take for example the absurd scene where a typical nuclear family is rocking out in the car on their way to a hypnosis show. All four are bobbing their heads to punk rock and shouting American profanities in unison.<br /><br />A cohesive story would have propelled this movie into greatness. But because it's so scatterbrained, it can safely be filed in the "two-hour music video" drawer. You might want to display it at the entrance to your home on special occasions -- like an Andy Warhol photograph. It can serve as a reminder of how absurd the world can get. "Yes, the world did have a story to tell once upon a time. It made absolutely no sense, but it had such a beautiful Christmas Tree!"<br /><br />If SURVIVE STYLE 5 is your cup of tea, I recommend Taste of Tea, released in 2004 starring Tadanobu Asano.<br /><br />JY<br /><br />Jimboduck-dot-com

How to describe the experience of watching SURVIVE STYLE 5+?! The look of the movie alone was enough to blow me away: it features fanciful costumes that look nothing like any clothes I've ever seen before, sets crammed with all manner of curios, and a use of color which is simply outrageous. Imagine WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN's aesthetic mixed with the texture of a Dali painting as filtered through a commercial for bubblegum. Then put it on overdrive and string it with Christmas lights...and you will only have begun to envision the glorious assault of brightness and fashion that is SURVIVE STYLE 5+. <br /><br />Fortunately, the movie's abundance of style is matched by its substance. The plot concerns 5 different main characters whose stories become intertwined in a variety of improbable, violent, and hilarious ways. We meet a song-and-dance hypnotist, a businessman who thinks he's a bird, a zombie wife who fires her arm off like a cannon, and a British hit-man who shows up periodically to ask "WOT IS YOUR FUNCTION IN LOIF?" before going nuts and stabbing people. All that, and I'm only describing the first half hour or so...<br /><br />Despite its absurd and surreal tone, SURVIVE STYLE 5+ makes complete logical sense. Never once does it veer into the no man's land of "weirdness for the sake of weirdness." The plot meanders all over the place, but there IS a method to its madness: a POINT to it all, a moral to figure out and mull over. In this regard, SURVIVE STYLE 5+ outclasses just about every movie of its type, by which I mean the recent rash of movies with multiple narratives that come together coincidentally. SURVIVE STYLE 5+ is definitely better than HAPPINESS. It may be better than PULP FICTION. MAGNOLIA shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence with it. Really, there is no movie I can adequately compare with SURVIVE STYLE 5+ because it seems like the first film of an entirely new genre. <br /><br />It's hilarious, too. Several days after viewing the movie, I still find myself walking down the street, remembering a funny scene or line, and laughing wildly to myself about it. <br /><br />So do what you can to see it on the big screen, then pray for a decent DVD release. You will NOT be disappointed.

First, a brief advice for those who haven't seen the film: expect bizarreness, randomness, random bizarreness, exaggerated randomness, and exaggerated bizarreness. However, beyond the exaggerated random bizarreness, the film doth have meanings that we can take away. It has style and substance, albeit a lot of style. FINAL VERDICT: highly recommended if you don't mind bizarre exaggerated randomness.<br /><br />The rest of my review provides an analysis of the meaning behind the lushly colorful sets and the exaggerated bizarreness. It will be most helpful to readers who have already viewed the film.<br /><br />As first glance, "Survival Style 5+" would seem a totally bizarre film-going experience. Indeed, few movies can claim to feature the following exaggerated acts:<br /><br />-a hot wife who visualizes a complete "speedy" internet commercial in her head, which uses olympic sprinters to compete in how "speedy" they can cum on the field by having sex.<br /><br />-a dead wife who breathes fire to light her husband's cigarette.<br /><br />-a middle-aged father who permanently turns into a bird by undergoing hypnosis. <br /><br />-an executive who answers an "important" phone call from his wife during business hours; "What is it?" He asks, and then his face shows great concern as he repeats after his wife: "What, the bathroom lights are out!"<br /><br />-an assassin asking a cooked broccoli what is its function in life.<br /><br />These are just a few examples to gear up your expectations for the randomness in the film. However as the film progresses, it becomes evident that it has meanings more than meet the eye. Why when the man wants to kill his wife, he can never succeed, but as soon as he retracts the intention, she is really dead? Why when the same wife cooks a full meal for the man, he is not pleased, but at the end he is happy to accept a less full meal from her? Why does the woman in commercial business run after her lost recordings, only to stop before she reaches it with a sigh: "I'm so stupid?"<br /><br />To me, this film illustrates the basic lessons learned in life through these wildly random events, and it all ties up at the end. The wife is not able to please the man with her cooking at first because she is feeding him what she wants to feed him, not what he wants to eat. Later, when she adjusts the food to his liking, both he and she are more satisfied. At first, the man is repeatedly killing his wife because he is a killer and that's what he is supposed to do. Even though he fails every time, he just repeats the same thing over and over again without thinking. He can never succeed killing her because the more we want something, the harder it seems to obtain. However when he finally has no intention of killing her any more, she is taken from him forever. How ironic. This incident also illustrates the inevitability of consequences from our actions: the man had hired a hit-man to kill his wife, and it comes back to haunt him. Therefore the man's action is responsible for his wife's death.<br /><br />Furthermore, the woman in commercial business is a workaholic. She has no personal life, and her husband detests her work. On Christmas eve, she is running with all her strength to retrieve missing work. As she races past the holiday decorations and Santa on the street, it finally hit her: she has been living in vain; on this day of celebration, she has nothing to celebrate and no one to celebrate with. And what about the band of thieves? During a near-death situation, two of them finally come out with their feelings, reinforcing the notion that tragedy brings people closer. As for the bird dad, he didn't turn into a bird without a purpose. It is a statement about coming to terms with who we are and who our neighbors are; we need to co-exist with people who are different from us, and it begins with accepting who we are and who they are.<br /><br />Although this review has concentrated on the film's meaning, I must take a moment to comment on the wildly imaginative visual style. This movie is a visual feast full of vibrant colors. Along the same style, the film definitely has its share of random, exaggerated situations. Why would the director take this exaggerated approach to illustrate the lessons of life, you might ask. The answer lies in the commercial expert Yoko's reply to her boss' criticism about the offbeat nature of her presentation: "You have to make something entertaining. Otherwise, people will not watch it," she says. Her bosses are pressing her to make another dull and straight-forward presentation; they think that spoon-feeding the audience is the only way for the us to grasp their intended meaning. Well, I am confident that most people who see this film will agree that Yoko's offbeat commercials would be more effective than any boring standard commercial. By taking the same offbeat, exaggerated approach to make this film, the director is trusting our ability to grasp the essence of his intentions, and we should be thankful for such filmmakers who have enough faith in their audience to take chances with a deliberately creative offering.

I learned about this series of Vitaphone shorts while channel surfing... I tuned into the Golf channel and was wondering why they were showing an old B&W film. <br /><br />I continued watching until I slowly came to realize who I was watching... the great Bobby Jones.<br /><br />I had seen the film biography of Jones... and have visited a lot of the Jones memorials in Augusta GA. But this was the first time I saw and heard the great man.<br /><br />Cool!<br /><br />I plan on getting the DVD version of this series, given the practical instruction (despite the use of archaic terms like "Mashie Niblick" and "Spoon." <br /><br />This film... and the others in the series, are very highly recommended for all golfers!

This tenth Bobby Jones short feature is the first one in this series I've seen and I was pleasantly surprised. It isn't just some dry golf lesson that only golfers could appreciate, but a little humor and story involved in it, with a couple of famous Hollywood personalities. However, more than anything, it shows off the amazing talents of the great golfer Bobby Jones.<br /><br />The "story" is a side bet that comedian Joe E. Brown (witnessed by actor Edward G. Robinson) makes with Jones on the course one day. He bets he can beat Bobby if the latter is forced to hit the ball from wherever the comedian hits it off the tee, and vice-versa. Of course, Brown hits it in horrible places, behind trees, in ditches, buried in sand traps, etc., but Jones shows how he still manages to get the ball not only on the green but near the hole, out of their almost-impossible conditions.<br /><br />As a past golfer, I can appreciate some of these shots by Jones. They are amazing. For example: few, if any, golfers today, including Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, could hit a one-iron as Jones does here.<br /><br />This turned out to be a fun little bonus feature. It was part of the DVD from the feature film, "Bullets Or Ballots."

This is the best novela ever made in my opinion. It's unlike any other novelas i saw. All the characters have both bad and good sides. There isn't any character put in negative light, nor any epitome of greed and prejudice like in most SOs (especially Mexican ones). Because of this moral balance, the plot and the relationships seem credible and appeal to you. It also leaves the impression that the mastermind actually spent serious time after coming up with such issues fertile for reflection. The love triangle between the mother, daughter and Edu is one of them. Pedro in-between the three women is another situation that stays interesting and unpredictable. The acting is excellent. I guess it has something to do with the nationality of the protagonists. The Brazilians are warm people and I always enjoy seeing and hearing them talking. The set is also a big plus. Rio de Janeiro and the ranch are both superb sites (although Rio has it's problems with poverty and violence). Over-all an excellent series. Don't mind the soap-opera tag, something like this has never been done before and i doubt something to best it is to be done soon.

Finally saw this last night on TCM, and I really can't believe the raves by the other posters! First, if Andy and Linda had actually hooked up, their kid would have looked like a gargoyle! Second, I didn't understand why Andy got Dink. Linda was probably a gold-digger who bailed the second Andy lost the belt, but fathers were very rarely awarded custody back then unless the mother was as an unfit a parent as Andy is!<br /><br />Which leads me to the fight. Beery flayed around like a crazed fish in search of water! Why no one told him that you punch straight ahead is beyond me! When Cooper started bawling for this loser, I wanted to deck him! He was so damn annoying throughout, but never more so than then!<br /><br />And what happened to Jonah? Didn't anyone care because, as Dink puts it, he's "colored"? That must be it.

You can't go past english comedy. And this movie only strengthens that statement. A hilarious collage of comedy, love, and just down right silliness. If you're feeling a bit on the down side, or you're inviting a couple of friends over for a flick, this is the movie for you. Don't miss it!

(mild spoilers)<br /><br />I had heard that this was a "tearjerker," but i was completely taken in by the simple story and the incredible relationship between Dink and The Champ.<br /><br />I spent the last half of the movie with tears rolling down my cheeks, and i was really struck by a lot of the little details that made the film play much better than a lot of movies nowadays. (And i am not saying that all movies today are bad, hey, i liked the Matrix and Lord of the Rings like everybody else.) But there are little moments, such as the way they hold hands walking out of the gambling joint, or the way Beery takes off his son's shoes and gets him ready for bed, then sits up and looks out the window in despair over having lost everything at the craps table. Just blew me away. <br /><br />The scene in the jail DESTROYED me, as did the final scene. Just such amazing characters, and you couldn't help but feel for them. Beery is such a terrific on screen presence , and Cooper was just a joy to watch. <br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

057: The Champ (1931) - released 11/9/1931; viewed 5/21/06.<br /><br />The Chinese Soviet Republic is declared by Mao Tse Tung.<br /><br />BIRTHS: Ike Turner.<br /><br />DOUG: King Vidor directs big bad Wallace Beery (Best Actor winner) and little Jackie Cooper in Frances Marion's moving screenplay The Champ. I've read that Wallace Beery was actually a rotten lunkhead offscreen and not really the lovable loser that he always played on screen. I guess little Cooper really was a good actor to make us believe the latter while enduring the former. This is a rare film made during the Depression that actually talks about it; most people preferred films that let them escape from the Depression entirely. Beery's Champ does everything he can to properly raise his son Dink, but he's not very smart, and he's not exactly a great father; he suffers from gambling and alcoholism, and it's often the kid who has to look after the dad. In the end, we forgive the Champ because he really tries, and he really does love that kid. Although he makes a lot of false promises ("I'll never drink again! No more gambling!"), we're behind him all the same because of Beery. At one point, he tries to send Dink to his mother's in a heartwrenching scene; when Dink tearfully refuses to go, Champ slaps him through the bars of his cell. Dink runs away crying, and Champ starts slapping his fist against the concrete wall in shame; he just hit his son! The final fight is quite effective, as he's fighting for a $20,000 purse that will put his son through school. I thought his heart problem could have used more setup. I didn't cry at the end, but dammit, I was close. I'd also like to point out Dink's friend Jonah, a black kid whose character is handled rather tastefully: "That's Jonah. He's colored." "Really? Pretty color." Awwww...<br /><br />KEVIN: Yes, I wept. I really loved The Champ. I was in no danger of dozing off during this film, as I was captivated in every scene. The role of Andy "Champ" Purcell is truly the role of a lifetime for Wallace Beery; I firmly believe that no other actor in history could ever nail this performance so perfectly, so this time the Academy was right for a change. One might say that this story kind of turns the anti-hero sentiment on its side. Rather than a sadistic thug hiding under a dapper exterior, Beery's "Champ" is a washed-out tough guy with a heart of gold. One of the less effective things about the film was the character of Linda, and Irene Rich's performance of her. It's much harder to sympathize with her struggle, even at the end. Fortunately, we don't see too much of her, and Beery and little Jackie Cooper dominate every scene. We see again and again not just that Andy is a loving father, but that he and Dink really take care for each other in ways that no one could understand. That's why it's so heartbreaking at the end when that union is broken forever and both Dink and we in the audience must come to terms with it and look forward to the future.<br /><br />Last film: The Platinum Blonde (1931). Next film: Frankenstein (1931).

Jackie Cooper was the top child actor at MGM in the early 30s when it was the top studio. He started off as part of "Our Gang" but just a year later was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in "Skippy" (he just lost out to Lionel Barrymore in "A Free Soul"). L. B. Mayer called him "a wonderful kid" and teamed him and Wallace Beery in the emotional and heart wrenching film "The Champ". It has the most tear drenching finale of any film I have ever seen and Jackie Cooper gives an outstanding performance as Dink, the little boy who has an unswerving faith in his hopelessly alcoholic father. The sets have a very gritty and real look - not at all what you would expect from MGM "the dream factory".<br /><br />Little Dink lives with his dad, a washed up fighter who can't stay off the booze. His managers try to talk him up to some promoters, promising that he is the same fighter he always was - Dink's job is to sober him up but unfortunately it doesn't work. Andy "The Champ" has always promised Dink a race horse and when his luck changes, he buys "Lil' Champ" - an old and beat up horse that they train up for a race. The day of the race Dink meets his mother (he or she doesn't realise it), Linda, who has the horse "Blue Boy" next to "Lil' Champ" in the stables. Dink introduces her to his little mate - "he's coloured" he says, "yes, but he's kind of a pretty colour" she replies. (It was interesting that you didn't see her shake hands with the little boy, their hands were out of the camera range).<br /><br />When "Lil' Champ" loses the race, Linda (Irene Rich)realises who Dink is and wants to give him everything that he has missed out on. (Even though Linda seems lovely - her character is portrayed as once having been a gold-digger who only married Andy when he was rich and famous and left him for a more prosperous gentleman when he was down on his luck).<br /><br />Andy is then paid $100 to let Dink visit his mother - while there he sings a few bars of a popular song (Ruth Ettings' "Don't Tell Him What Happened to Me"), meets his step-sister Mary Lou (adorable Marcia Mae Jones) a little cutie who talks to Dink about the reality of fairy tales. After his visit Linda is determined to take Dink away from the unwholesome life he is leading with his dad. Dink and Andy have a magical relationship but after a heartfelt scene Andy convinces Dink to live with his mother, but with Dink away, he loses the will to go on.<br /><br />The ending is the most emotional ever and Jackie Cooper was a genuine star. There will not be a dry eye by the film's end. In an interview, I heard Jackie Cooper say he did not get on with Wallace Beery. They made a few pictures together and were considered a team, adored by the public. Cooper said whenever people stopped him in the street to ask what Beery was really like, he had to lie and say what a wonderful guy he was - he couldn't tell them the truth and spoil their illusion. The previous reviewer was right - Beery was not well liked.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.

This almost eighty-year old film will bring both a tear and a smile. It is the story of washed-up and somewhat alcoholic boxer Andy Purcell (Wallace Beery), just known as "Champ" to everyone, including his adoring little son, "Dink", played by Jackie Cooper. It's as though life has really ceased to have meaning for the Champ ever since he lost his championship status. The only thing that continues to give his life meaning is his son. The Champ isn't exactly providing a wholesome environment for Dink. Dink hangs out in pool halls with his Dad, isn't enrolled in school, and sits up nights alone in their dingy room waiting for the Champ to come home when he is out on a drinking binge. Champ's ex-wife, socialite Linda, sees Andy and Dink at the racetrack one day and tries to convince Andy that Dink would be better off with her. At first the Champ is unpersuaded. However, when he gets a hold of a good sum of money and gambles it away and winds up in the drunk tank overnight he decides that maybe it is for the best if Dink goes with Linda.<br /><br />Wallace Beery had some lean times after motion pictures transitioned to sound, however he got a new lease on his career at MGM, and it turned out that his coarse voice attracted fans rather than repelled them. He won a well-deserved Best Actor award for his role, but if there had been a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1931 it would have gone to nine-year old Jackie Cooper. He is comic as the street-wise kid meeting his half-sister for the first time - "The dame is goofy" he remarks. He is heart-rending when the Champ tells him he doesn't want him around any more, that he's tired of feeding him, just so he'll go with his mother.<br /><br />A minor point that made this film so refreshing for me is that nobody tries to "lawyer up" or turn Dink's fate into a courtroom battle. Everyone deals with everyone else in this film on decent human terms. In the end the Champ tries to regain the championship so he can provide a good life for his son and so that his son can respect him, not so that he can win a custody fight.

In the worst years of the depression, the most popular stars were not the most glamorous or attractive. As revealed in the highly respected Quigley poll (which surveyed movie theatre owners on who their audiences were most likely to come and see), the biggest draws in the early 30s were friendly, earthy types whom audiences could relate to at a time of poverty and desperation. These included genial comic Will Rogers, middle-aged frump Marie Dressler, and burly pug-face Wallace Beery, who played his greatest role in 1931 feature The Champ.<br /><br />Beery's physique meant he was often cast as villainous thugs, but he had demonstrated enough acting prowess to get a decent number of "gentle giant" lead roles. In The Champ he gets to combine the two, one minute the swaggering pugilist, the next a devoted father. He gives a performance full of tiny gestures, expertly dancing from one expression to another. When he gets to show his character's emotional vulnerability, the scene is doubly poignant coming after the macho confidence he normally displays. The knowledge that off the set Beery was reputedly a wife-beating brute who bullied everyone around him perhaps spoils the effect slightly, but even with this in mind his performance is captivating, believable and utterly flawless.<br /><br />Supporting Beery behind the camera is a director who was both a poet and a craftsman of the cinema  King Vidor. Vidor excelled at coaxing naturalism from his players at a time when theatrical hamming was the par. His camera focuses on Beery for long takes, allowing the actor to potter about doing his little bits of business and developing the character. Vidor also gives the picture bite with some neat tracking shots. These are usually in the field depth, so in other words we are either backing away from the actors or following them. The former kind, with the players advancing on the camera as in the shot that opens the picture, gives the characters presence and show them as a force to be reckoned with. The latter kind, where the camera follows the character, physically pulls us into their world. Vidor used these kinds of shot a lot, and they are a neat way of making the audience feel involved without drawing too much attention to the artificiality of the form.<br /><br />It may come as a surprise that this story of male bonding was written by a woman, Frances Marion. But like Beery, Marion defied expectations simply by being very good at what she did. Her plot for The Champ earned her the second of her two Oscars. It does not perhaps describe the most realistic of situations, but the emotional content is very sincere, and its depiction of determination and human feeling during hard times must have struck a chord with audiences of the day. The dialogue, which is credited to three separate people, is appropriately punchy with lines that sound believable yet are memorable and evocative.<br /><br />Aside from Beery, the rest of the cast are a good bunch. Of all the lead players, Irene Rich is the only one who doesn't stand out, and she seems simply there to fill the wealthy, motherly type. But having said that she is not at all bad and her presence doesn't harm the picture. The Champ also sees Roscoe Ates in one of his largest roles, and for once getting to appear as a normal person rather than the stuttering fool he was usually required to play. Finally there is Jackie Cooper, one of the greatest child stars of his or indeed any era. While it seems clear that fame has gone to the youngster's head (he's not quite as good as he thinks he is), he is certainly up to the task of carrying his end of the picture. He plays a genuine child when with Beery, but when he is around others he deepens his voice and adopts mannerisms as if trying to be an adult. It's a touching and appropriate performance and very suited to the tone of the picture. And this was perhaps also the only time in which a child actor like Cooper could become a personality in his own right. As the popularity of Beery, Dressler et al proves, this was the age of the unconventional superstar.

"The Champ" is a heartwarming experience,with a great performance by Jackie Cooper who steals the whole show.Wallace Beery won an Oscar for his portrayal of the brawling ex-fighter who loves his son deeply. The chemistry between Beery and Cooper is the movie's core. It's nice to see that both the mother and stepfather are portrayed as sympathetic people.Beery's portrayal manages also to convey the flaws in the character of The Champ,which is why we understand how his wife could leave him.But as an ex-boxing champ he's not very believable. The final bout is laughingly choreographed and looks silly. But it is a film I would want to see again.

I've just finished watching this film, which I've been wanting to see for years and I was impressed without being overwhelmed. Wallace Beery's not bad (though a bit stilted) in the leading role; he's better than Irene Rich, playing his ex-wife, who throws herself around the screen, swooning from sofa to sofa in a totally over-acted performance. However, it's Jackie Cooper who steals the show with a portrayal which manages to be both heart-rending and realistic. I know the concept of "real sound" is a disputable one, as sounding real on screen may just entail being a good actor, rather than a realistic one, but nonetheless he does seem far more genuine than the rest of the cast. 8/10.

Probably the greatest disconnect among film personalities in history is that of Wallace Beery. On the screen he played these lovable oaf types, even when he was a bad guy. Off the screen he was a violent man, given to fits of temper and I can't recall anyone having a good word to say about him. Possibly for that reason Beery could lay claim to the fact he was the greatest actor in films. The crowning achievement of his career was his Oscar winning performance in The Champ.<br /><br />Of course Beery could not have done it without little Jackie Cooper as well. It's their scenes together that make the film as memorable as it is. Instead of splitting the Academy Award with Fredric March who was also awarded The Best Actor for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, possibly Beery should have given half of his half to Cooper.<br /><br />Beery is actually a former champ in this film. He's an over the hill, alcoholic pug who lives a hand to mouth existence with his young son Cooper. He split from his wife Irene Rich years ago, taking Cooper and she'd like to get him back. She's pretty well fixed now with a new and rich husband and a daughter by that marriage. <br /><br />The fly in the ointment is that Cooper is really attached to his father and blind to the faults he has. And Beery really does love his son, the only really happy part about his life. He's probably way too old to be seriously in the fight game, but he needs the dough for his kid.<br /><br />The Champ is guaranteed four handkerchief film even now almost eighty years after its debut. A remake was done in 1979 with Jon Voight and Rick Schroder in the main two roles, but it wasn't a patch on this one.

When I first saw this movie it was my first look at either Wallace Beery or Jackie Cooper. I found both of them very interesting to watch. I also found out why Bob Hope and Jack Benny used to make a lot of sarcastic lines about "being about as pretty as Wallace Beery." He definitely had an ugly "mug." However, he was a lovable loser, at least in this film.<br /><br />Cooper played "Dink," a cocky little kid who just loved "The Champ" (Beery). On the VHS tape, Cooper's squeaky little voice did not come across well and often was annoying to hear.<br /><br />The boxing scenes were hokey but I liked the ending because at least Beery won the fight, although he collapses afterward. I believe he lost in the re-make of this with Jon Voight and Ricky Shroder in the 1979 film, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />The kid's devotion to the champ, even under the toughest of situations, was touching. With clearer sound and picture, I would have kept the tape. I should check out the DVD.

'The Champ' seems to have been a blueprint film for all the others of the tough-tender school that followed it, and - owing entirely to Jackie Cooper's playing perfectly off of Wallace Beery's has-been, alcoholic pug - it's perfectly charming.<br /><br />Yes, the fight scene is rather hokey: had they tried to use Wallace Beery's telegraphed-the-day-before roundhouse punches, even the toe-to-toe sluggers of 'The Champ's bygone day wouldn't have survived one round in the ring. But the film isn't about the fight scene, it's about the love of father for son and son for father - and to this day 'The Champ's' story artfully delivers its soft knock-out blow with tender sucker punches and love-taps to the heart.<br /><br />Compared with today's fare 'The Champ's' pacing is slow but the time taken works nicely, especially in the one-on-one scenes captivatingly played by Cooper and Beery.<br /><br />There's plenty of archetypal King Vidor composition-in-frame that's still imitated today, and in many instances the lighting is exemplary of the gorgeous black & white textural artistry of Hollywood's Golden Age. Lovers of classic B&W work might want to grab more than a few frames from the DVD.<br /><br />Beery's work is quite good here, but Jackie Cooper's remarkable, potent chops steal the show - and your heart; though 'The Champ' has a good many fine, classical attributes there's none better in it than Cooper's unforgettable performance.

I was blown away by this flick. I have never heard of this movie until one of my friends had purchased the DVD. The movie has no one very famous in it, but the acting, dialogue and story are terrific. It is a hilarious movie. I highly recommend it.

Former heavyweight champ Andy Purcell goes down to Tijuana in hopes of getting a fight. Andy's son, Dink, watches his father train, but Andy gives into his vices of gin and gambling, which constantly gets him in trouble. Andy wins Dink a race horse, which is entered in a race, where Andy meets his ex-wife Linda (with her current husband Tony) at the track and wants to be reunited with her son (Dink) and give him a better life outside of the one Andy gives him. Andy gets arrested and thrown in jail, where he decides that Dink would be best living with his mother, which devastates Dink (who idolizes his father). Andy is released from jail (thanks to Tony & Linda)and gets a bout with the Mexican heavyweight champ, where Dink runs back to his father to watch him hopefully win the fight, even though he is out of shape and not at the level of his opponent. The film is a toughing piece of cinematic brilliance, despite the static camera-work (very uncharacteristic of King Vidor). Beery and Cooper work so well together and their performances are what makes this film a classic. The script does not lose anything in the 70 plus years since its release. If the ending doesn't make you shed tears, you have to be a robot. Rating, 8.

this film showed this cynic that romance can still work on the big screen. Funny in a variety of ways the way that only the French can really do successfully. I pray that the US resists the urge to remake it!

This movie, with out a doubt, made me laugh more than any movie I have seen! I love the plot. It's two completely absurd people who fall in love before ever meeting because they're both weirdos!!! It's SO great!!! But that's not all, Amelie decides she wants to do good in the world, make a difference, and she does in the most absurd and hilarious ways.

What a fantastic movie, I've seen this movie many times and it's just as god and funny every time. Audery Tautou's performances is amazing, she is perfect as Amelie, she really make this movie flying! The atmosphere is also fantastic. Well, I can say that everything is perfect in this movie, everything you have to see it, is just so fantastic that you almost wound believe it. A suburb 10 out of 10.

I suppose to fully appreciate Amelie, one would first have to appreciate the work of Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Jeunet creates characters that are sweet, simple, and (of course) interesting. Amelie, as the full title suggests, takes place in France. But not quite the France you may know. The France in Amelie is borderline between surreal and real, making the story of Amelie much like a fairy-tale. The main character, Amelie, is struggling to find her place in a world in which she does not seem to fit in. She feels finally at peace with her life when she finally feels she has found her goal in life...changing people's lives for the better. I don't want to give too much away, but overall, Amelie is a uniquely sweet story, with a uniquely sweet soul; just like...well, Amelie.

Amelie is such a loveable character! Flawed and insecure, yet good-hearted, she is charming. Audrey Tautou captures all the winning qualities of this character, and makes you really care about her interactions with the quirky people in her life. The camerawork is original and cheerful, the narrations are hilarious, and the message of the movie is wonderful: the best thing you can do with your life is to be a ray of light and goodness to those around you, just like Amelie.

In the Netherlands everything with the word french in it, usually means something half finished, but that by no means applies to this absolutely wonderful film. It is funny, without slapstick, it is sweet, without sickeningly so and it is romantic. What else do you want from a feel-good film? The way the voice-over is doing his voice-overing is brilliant and the love-scenes are beautiful. Definitely a film to watch time and time again.

Possible Spoilers!!!!<br /><br />Wow. What else can I say?<br /><br />This is the ultimate movie experience. It has everything! Excellent direction, gorgeous cinematography, great story, a score that always suits the mood and as for Audrey Tautou...<br /><br />This is without doubt the single greatest performance by an actress ever committed to celluloid. In the title role she not only plays Amelie Poulian, she embodies her.<br /><br />The tagline, "She'll change your life" is true. After watching AMELIE you will feel compelled to help a blind man cross the road or more importantly, you'll feel sure that there is a love out there for you. This is REAL magic.

This movie tries so hard to be cute and clever that its concentrated sweetness gave me a high for about five minutes and then I crashed for the rest of it. <br /><br />Amalie (Audrey Tautou) has the demeanor of a spoiled little girl who grew up thinking she was ever so cute. She seems to be saying, "Look at me, can you resist me?" And then she gives off a self-satisfied smile with the hint, "You thought I was cute before, aren't you blown away by my smile?" Ugh.<br /><br />But the thing that really bugs me about this movie is Amelie's conceit. She presumes to know what will make others happy and meddles in their lives. Among the things this adorable girl does is break and enter an apartment to do mean things to its owner's possessions, send false letters, short out people's TV's at peak moments, lie to people about who loves them, make anonymous phone calls without having the integrity to speak with the callee, and steal one of her father's prize possessions.<br /><br />I know that we are supposed to accept the fantasy nature of this film where photos talk, statues wink, and people always answer public phones, but my patience for this kind of thing wore thin very fast. We are told, shown actually, that Amelie's mother was killed by a suicidal person jumping off of Notre Dame and landing on her. How are are we supposed to react to that? Is it supposed to be funny? Wasn't to me.<br /><br />Then there is the agonizing game that Amelie plays with the guy she falls far. She gives him hints and, given the opportunity to make contact, shies away. You just want to shake her and tell her to just talk to the guy for heaven's sake. Finally at the end they meet and the first thing they do without saying a word is kiss and have sex. What kind of message is that? <br /><br />The whole movie is filmed through some kind of orange filter that I suppose is meant to cast some sort of romantic candle-lit effect over the proceedings, but for me it was just one more barrier that prevented me from getting close to this movie.

I don't really understand why so many people say that this is one of the greatest films. It is actually a pretty film, with an excellent style. Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a good director and the film is not boring at all. However, is it a "wonderful film" as some say? I do not think so. The actors are (of course) good, but Jeunet shows us Paris as a marvelous place. And yet, I know what Paris is like, since I live in that city. And I can say that it is not the same thing at all. I do not say to jeunet to be realistic (and anyway he could not be realistic), but just to be fair with this place, which is not a real wonder.

I must say, after I've watched this move, I now consider it my all-time favorite. Everything is just awesome! The casting - perfect. The story - so cute and funny you just have to love it. Don't miss this awesome piece of art, or you'll regret it!

This movie came highly recommended by nearly everybody. Thus, perhaps my disappointment was a result of high expectations.<br /><br />The movie is original in the way that the life of Amelie (and her friends/family/acquaintances) is presented; However the novelty wears off after an hour or so, and all that's left is a trite, highly predictable movie that I wound up turning off. 3/10

I highly anticipated this film, as it received mostly great reviews & was given many award nominations. What I saw was a picture post card of beautiful Paris & surrounding areas, nicely acted by all. BUT where oh where was the story, The film ran over 2 hours, That was 40 minutes longer than it deserved. When are we going to see films about happy nice people living their lives & not neurotics like displayed here. This was supposed to be a comedy & I hardly laughed lightly more than twice. Rating **1/2 78 points IMDb 7

i have seen this film a few times but have never really been drawn to the storyline, i find the story predictable and boring, how ever i find the filming of the movie is eye catching and very cleverly done. the films major downside is that it is in french, with reading the translation below the screen you miss half of the story and the main events of the film.<br /><br />the film is about a young lady called Amelie who finds a box in her bathroom, and starts her search to return it to the rightful owner, along the way he imagination brings even the little repeated event to be blown into a huge per portion.<br /><br />with watching the film numerous times i have now picked up on the camera work and the magnificent colours, with noticing in the first time i watch Amelie the fantastic camera work and special effect which bring the film to life and help tell the story with out the translation, the camera work has defiantly made up for the storyline in Amelie and you notice something every time you watch the film.the colours also help the film and always give your eyes something to notice.<br /><br />i dislike this film but at the same time i love it, Jean-Pierre Jeunet has made up his story line with fascinating camera angles and shots which have even made the biggest movies look dull.<br /><br />i would recommend this film to other media students who would like to look at good camera work and fantastic colours but not to someone who would like a good storyline.

**very mild spoilers**<br /><br />I rented "Amelie" reluctantly. I had the impression that it would be a "girlie" film with meandering narrative and boring angst-ridden characters.<br /><br />I am so glad I was wrong! What I did get was a "magical realism" tale of an introverted woman trying to improve the lives of the people around her. Amelie, through clever scheming and gentle intervention, facilitates delightful life experiences for her fellow characters.<br /><br />The film does move at a slower pace, but the plot points are endearing, and it never drags. Every scene has a subtextual significance, where every shot adds a tiny sense of guilty voyeurism as we peek gentle into these people's lives.<br /><br />The plot devices are purposely stretched to fantastical lengths at times. Laurant and Jeunet use this "magical" aspect of the realism to cultivate an optimism and effervescence that you won't find in any Hollywood movie today. The mood is always dreamy in this film, yet is never childish.<br /><br />The characters will warm your heart. Audrey Tatou is perfect as the shy-yet-smouldering Amelie, and Jamel Debbouze is perfect as the impish Lucien.<br /><br />You will love the sub plots of Amelie convincing her father to travel, and how she seeks gentle vengeance on the wicked grocer. The scheme to introduce herself to Nino, and the plot to do matchmaking at the cafe. All of these little stories are bound to tweak your heartstrings!<br /><br />In the end: Amelie will leave you with feeling that "Pay it Forward" should have left you with... a buoyant and optimistic affection for humanity and life!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone, whether you are an action fan, an intellectual, or a feel-good Hollywood movie buff. There are clever plot elements and characterization that are good for all movie fans!<br /><br />9 kernels of popcorn out of 10.<br /><br />

This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is romantic an absolute non-icky way, it shows a humans kindness in whole new lighting and Nino and Amelie share this delicate, tender, gentle love without many words said. Jean-Pierre made this film colorful like only few other people did or could do. Paris looks absolute dreamy and it makes you wish you were born in Paris, in Montmartre, with french as your mother tongue. It makes you wanna do something beautiful with your life, to yourself and to others, of course. It makes you brave, although you think of yourself to be the worst coward ever to live on this planet. Acting is perfect and I still can't get over the fact it didn't win an Oscar for best foreign film. Music goes along with the movie just great, it just right, it sets the perfect mood for the viewer. I really recommend this movie to everyone because I can guarantee you won't be disappointed!!!

<br /><br />This piece of art just shocked me.Not by non-sense visual or sound effects,not by its hard,war scenes,not by its too-profound-to-be-understood psycho-socio-sexual comment ,but by its h u m a n i t y. Humanity...Just think about that.Have we all forgotten the sense of this word?In a world that depresses us into our little caves,in a period when no-one is safe and sure about the intentions of his/hers neighbour ,thoughts about giving LOVE and HAPPINESS to the people surrounding you,me,everyone are really really precious. I do not want to speak about the plot,this you have already read in other comments around.I only want to say one thing.If you believe that people can love and give,then just go see this movie right now.You deserve it!<br /><br />P.S:The soundtrack is just "parfait" as well...

...in conversations about this movie who simply doesn't like it. When I say that "I hate it", everyone starts to praise the whole movie. <br /><br />Reasons I don't like this movie are:<br /><br />1) All too happy in a too sweet way 2) Soundtrack, which is the most stereotyped soundtrack I have listened to 3) Characters. The main character is simply a nut job 4) The overall look and feeling of it. Those zooms and tracking shots...<br /><br />I've always thought that if Amelie would have been an Hollywood movie, everyone would have said "It too sappy", but now when it is in french: "Aaah...it's so nice." Yet again, I feel I'm the only one who thinks this way. <br /><br />For some reason this movie just didn't work for me. I'm not a pessimist or anything, but all that chirpy and happy feeling just don't cut it. <br /><br />Having watched other Jeunet's movies, I think that his style just doesn't work for me.

<br /><br />This movie is stylish beyond belief. But what strikes me most is the way it manages to capture the reality of human emotions, how internal monologues are played out in the form of TV programs, how dreams are simulated by the magical movements of inanimate objects and talking photographs! It is a charismatic portrayal of inner existence and the most natural desire to pursue happiness, both in our life and that of others.

If ever I needed a movie dubbed, this one would be it. Normally, I prefer subtitles, but the visuals in here are so incredible that trying to read the subtitles distracts me from taking in all there is to see.<br /><br />Man, there is a lot to see: brilliant, beautiful colors in scene-after-scene. They alone make this DVD worth owning. The story is decent, pretty interesting but nothing super. The humor is "French," meaning different from what we normally laugh at in North America. The story also, to be honest, gets frustrating after awhile, as Amelie goes on too long with her charade. If you've watched it, you know what I mean.<br /><br />However, this is so uniquely and beautifully filmed that I can put up with a so-so story. As the lead actress, Audrey Tautou, is cute and fun to watch and the addition of humor to the romance story helps. There is almost no profanity in here and a few very quick nude shots which must be the reason for the "R" rating, otherwise it would be an easy "PG." <br /><br />In summary, a pleasant film that is a feast for the eyes.

Amelie is a film that struck a certain chord with me. Every now and then movies come along that speak out to you and emotionally touch you in some way. Amelie is one such film for me. I related to its innocent charm and delightfully shy protagonist played by French sensation Audrey Tautou, the way very few films have. Part of the reason we watch movies is to learn something about ourselves or recognize characters that are remarkably similar to us and the way we are in real life. For all of us shy, introverted, quirky, and odd-ball eccentrics out there who have trouble relating to "normal" people, Audrey Tautou in this film is our personal hero. Instead of going into much detail about why the film works, I'll instead try to explain what it meant to me personally. Sure I guess this means I have to open up maybe more than I'd like to about myself, but oh well. The way Amelie's childhood was presented is similar to my own. I am an only child to divorced parents and very rarely had friends as I was and still am very much a loner. As a child much of my time was spent alone so I entertained myself in all kinds of silly ways. Just like Amelie does in the film. Of course I gained my fixation with films at an extremely early age, but also did stupid things like give my stuffed animals personalities and have conversations with them, draw pictures and create stories to go along with them, and laid in bed listening to the radio with the windows open on a lazy summer day imagining creatures out of the cloud formations. Apparently there are legions of us out there. Even today I enjoy solitude far more than the company of most people and still use my imagination to think of stupid little things. Amelie did an amazing job in capturing what the world is like through the eyes of a person who doesn't really fit in, but finds joy in the simple things in life. Like the fresh spring breeze on your face, the sound of the rain, the chirping of birds, the touch of fur, and popping bubble wrap. Actually popping bubble wrap was always an exciting and rare treat during my youth. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film also has a marvelously fun nifty view of sex. For Amelie sex is not something that is intimidating, temptingly desirable, sinful, adult, or lustful. It's just another of the many silly things that people do in this world that make us human. Two people taking off their cloths and rubbing up against one another. How sweet! In fact many people have insulted the film for it's unique view and open attitude towards sex. For shame really. Sure there's a lot of it actually. Amelie's first sexual encounter, the orgasms, the object of her affection working in a porn shop with a stripper and putting price tags on didoes. But it's all in good fun and filmed with the naivety that a character like Amelie would view sex as. Anyways the movie really works. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel does an excellent job in filming Jeunet's crazy vision and Audrey Tautou with her funky hairdo, wide brown eyes, and whimsical voice and kitten like mannerisms and shyness brings the movie to life. As I said I relate to this movie and understand the character the way I do with few other movies simply because it is frighteningly very much like I tend to be in real life. <br /><br />"You mean she would rather imagine herself relating to an absent person than build relationships with those around her?"<br /><br />Hmm, so would I sometimes. Audrey Tautou's been a more reliable friend than most people and has put a smile on my face and lightened my day at the thought of her more times than one. And I still say I'll marry her one day.

I rather enjoyed watching "Shooting Fish" on a hot, humid summer night, when there was nothing better to do than rent a video. It's a nice film, and has some very funny scenes, but it's also a very light one, and doesn't require too much attention. If you're looking for a light and breezy comedy, you can't go wrong with this one.

In 1974, in Enghien in the northern suburbs of Paris, the girl Amélie Poulain was born and raised alone by her cold hearted father and her stressed mother due to a mistake of her father's evaluation of her heart conditions. Her mother dies in a weird accident and when the shy and daydreamer Amélie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) becomes a young woman, she moves to central Paris and works as waitress in the café Deux Moulins in Montmartre. On 30 August 1997, Amélie finds a child treasure hidden behind the wall that belonged to a dweller from the 50's, and she decides to anonymously return it to the owner. He seeks out the man and when she witnesses his happiness, she decides to become the "godmother of the rejected", anonymously helping people that are her acquaintances using her fantasy and little tricks. She convinces her father to travel abroad using his garden gnome; she helps her neighbor that is an outcast and lonely painter and the super that misses her unfaithful husband; she also helps her hypochondriac colleague that works in the tobacco shop and the man that stalks the other waitress acting like cupid; she plays pranks to an employer that mistreats his employee with abusive relationship. When Amélie finds the album of photos of an intriguing collector that collects rejected photos in the Photomaton of the Gare de l'Est, she seeks him out and falls in love with him. On 28 September 1997, Amélie Poulain finds love.<br /><br />"Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain" is certainly one of the sweetest and most original movies of cinema history. The surrealistic screenplay is stunning and it is impossible not falling in love for the character performed by the expressive Audrey Tautou. The direction and the acting are top-notch, supported by awesome camera work and the cinematography, excellent edition and magnificent soundtrack. This is a delightful romance even when you watch it for the second time, My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "O Fabuloso Destino de Amelie Poulain" ("The Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain")

-If one needs more proof why foreign films are superior to American crap then look no further this gem. it's beautiful, magical, funny, sad, and wonderfully romantic <br /><br />-Amelie tells the story of a girl with a highly active imagination. statues come to life, TV's can talk to her and pictures can move around. Her mom dies in a semi-hilarious scene which means she has to spend the rest of her life with her dad. Her dad is a very distant man that seldom shows affection. he's not a bad father by any chance, in fact he loves her daughter more than anything in the world, but he just dosen't know how to express his love for her properly so he becomes a bit distant from him This leads to Amelie having to retreat into her imagination to find people to talk to since her dad won't. she makes up imaginary friends to play with and keeps herself entertained by over imagining what she sees in everyday life<br /><br />-the movie really begins about 20 mins. into the story. She discovers through TV that princess DI has died in a car crash and so shocked by it that she drops a marble in her hand. the marble rolls in the bathroom till it hits a wall. she pushes aside the tiny wall to discover that it's where a little boy hid his toy a long time ago. so she decides to return it to him, and when the boy whose now a man finds it he's so grateful that he begins to cry. this leaves Amelie feeling so happy that she decides to spend the rest of her life doing good deeds to those who deserve it. she helps out a grocer whose been emotionally abused by his manager, helps a blind man cross the street whiles describing everything in sight, and she reunites a weeping widow with her husband through a letter. as things move along she meets a guy that she falls in love with and the entire 4th act of the movie basically shows how the two of them get together <br /><br />-french director Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings a unique visual style to this movie. it's almost as if you're watching the movie through a dream. it also one of the best cinematography ever to be committed on film. the beautiful Audrey Tatou plays the title character and the supporting cast also do an amazing job. this is one of those movies that leave you in a good mood after you watch it. plus it will leave you in stitches from laughing so hard. the "Orgasm Montage" has to be one of the funniest scenes in cinema history and that is one of the many reason why this movie is awesome <br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

Waiting for `Amelie' to begin in a theater fraught with noisy college students drinking cheap beer, I wasn't expecting anything more than an over-hyped flick from our friends in France. I slowly began to realize as I watched Amelie skip stones in the canal that for the very first time, a film deserved all of hype it had been accorded and more, and I felt so blessed to be a part of this revelation.<br /><br />Possible Spoilers<br /><br />It's hard to put into words how much I loved `Amelie.' I felt as though I were sitting next to Monet, watching as he effortlessly splashed brilliant watercolors across his canvas. I had this strange but fantastic feeling of being inside the mind of Amelie, seeing everything in the vibrant colors she viewed life with, and wanting to remain there much longer than the two hours allotted. It was just so refreshing to watch a movie where your imagination was free to soar rather than feel confused by the apparent deja vu from last year's first installment of the same pointless drivel.<br /><br />I almost always loathe films with subtitles as I feel that they get in the way of viewing the characters actions and facial expressions. `Amelie' is the first film where I adored the subtitles and in fact, had a nagging urge to go out and learn French that is still with me today. Much of this can be attributed to the delightful Audrey Tatou. Her expressive eyes and sweet caring nature provided the viewer with fond memories of Audrey Hepburn and prevented me from being distracted by the subtitles. Could a 23 year old actress with little experience be just as fantastic as Meryl Streep and Katharine Hepburn? I really wasn't expecting it but Audrey Tatou revitalized my interest in film and left me wondering why her name didn't appear on Academy ballots and what possessed the Academy to favor `No Man's Land.'<br /><br />An already perfect film couldn't get much better but along with the lovingly created cinematography and delight of rising star Tatou came the wonderful story of a true do-gooder. `Amelie' is a film that begs you to get happy and should give some short-term contentment to even the most depressed of individuals. Little moments like the tragically funny early years of Amelie are very special and the best I've seen on the silver screen. The scene where Amelie is skipping stones in the canal should be studied for years to come as the greatest technical moment in cinema.<br /><br />Movies like this one don't come around very often. Perhaps the creators of films that pander to dumbed-down audiences who apparently can't tell that their watching last year's film should take the hint. The movie-going public wants to be inspired and wants to be provided with the same imagination they have when reading a great novel. This is why `Amelie' remains #18 on the list of best films.<br /><br />10/10

Rating: ***1/2 out of ****<br /><br />What a fun film! From the moment it begins, "Amelie" bursts with joy and energy. It's a fable of sorts, a love letter to a Paris fondly dreamt of by many. It may not be the real world, but it is such a delightful fantasy that it doesn't matter how unbelievable some of it may be. "Amelie" is the rare romantic comedy that has both the romance and the comedy. It isn't very surprising that this has been a hit in France for a while now, and I have no doubt it will find the audience it needs in the States as well.<br /><br />Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a nave girl working at the Two Windmills Caf. When she was a child her mother and teacher was an innocent victim of a suicide gone awry. Amelie stayed with her father until she was old enough to leave and lead a life of her own. One day she finds a small box of treasures behind a tile in her wall, she decides to return it to her owner and become a natural do-gooder. Later on, she catches a man groping for lost photos under a photo booth (Nino Quincampoix, played by Mathieu Kassovitz), and it's love at first sight. She decides to go on a quest to find this man and help anyone she can along the way (including her father and co-workers).<br /><br />I said before that this film was a love letter to Paris, it is also a love letter to Amelie herself. Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director and co-screenwriter) conjured the film like a dream, as if Amelie is his dream girl and he is trying to save her and bring her to a happy ending. It's not hard to want everything to work out for her and her friends. Amelie Poulain is the kind of person who you wish was your best friend, your neighbor or your sister. She bounces along with good grace and whimsy living life to its fullest, yet keeping a mischievous grin. She has her own idea of justice that isn't very disagreeable. The tormentors must in turn be tormented; the lifeless must be brought to life. The film is like a non-musical "Bells Are Ringing", with our heroine bringing so much life to those around her but neglecting her wants and needs.<br /><br />After seeing Audrey Tautou as Amelie, I can't possibly imagine anyone else in that role. She embodies Amelie like no one else could, she is a rare find that pulls off the job of breathing life into Amelie in spades. Wait, I take that back. She does not just breathe life into Amelie, Tautou makes her jump off the screen and pull the audience into the story. It would be a crime for her not to get a Best Actress nomination for her role.<br /><br />Magical is the world that Amelie lives in, where photos and lamps come alive to aid her quest, where TV shows are showing nothing but her story. The story this setting surrounds is pretty standard, and presented plainly could have just been another machine-processed romantic comedy. Is it too sappy? No. On the contrary, the film takes quite a few steps to make sure it doesn't become tacky or conventional. The rich, storybook setting and a witty screenplay (asides are taken to deepen our connection each character, little things that each likes and dislikes) make the film all the more a delight to watch. The cinematography, crafted by Bruno Delbonnel, does wonders for "Amelie". The camera captures the action with an eye of a child in a candy store, beautifully bringing about each shot as a new discovery.<br /><br />With films like "The Widow of Saint-Pierre", "With a Friend Like Harry" and box-office hit "Brotherhood of the Wold", French cinema has had quite a year. It's a delight that we round off the year with "Amelie", a fresh, funny journey that could have easily just been more Meg Ryan-esque romantic comedy fodder. If not for anything else, see it for Tautou's performance, but prepare to be smothered in a dream world.

It is the best film i've ever seen.Only the French could make films as good as this. Amélie explores the trivial things in life and it brings you to some realisations of your own in that our lives are so simple and we only need the simplest of things to keep us happy. Amélie is a must for anyone

A year ago, if someone would have asked me "What is your favorite movie ?" , I would not have known what to answer exactly, maybe Fight Club, maybe Vertigo, Indiana Jones even would have come to my mind.<br /><br />Since June, I have but one answer: 'Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain' !!! It is simply unique in his kind. And now it has come out in the US, I am a bit frightened, because everybody there describes it as a simple 'feel-good movie'. It is so much more than that ! Never before has a movie INFLUENCED my life in such a way. Audrey's performance is simply stunning... she plays with an innocence, a wit, a smartness and naïvity that even someone with 40 years experience could not have done better. (please, will someone give an oscar to that girl, she makes Kidman & Blanchett look pale :-) The score from Yann Tiersen is so beautiful that by now I'm addicted to it ( I read here somewhere something about 'accordeon jingle', please, get some education ;-). The story itself could easily have been abused, and I'm sure that if Hollywood had made this movie, it would have been ridiculous, but now it is a beauty, a pearl amidst broken hearts.<br /><br />This movie is for everyone who understands passion or who has lost his/her childhood somewhere along the way. If you love art & music, sunshine & poetry than you are qualified for seeing this movie, be warned though...this movie can change your life (and maybe..it will ;-)!<br /><br />Audrey is superb, Matthieu is better than himself, every actor gives a stunning performance, the scenery is beautiful, the whole movie is amusing, entertaining and charming, even CGI is perfectly done ! 10 out of 10 !!!<br /><br />a 21-year-old Amélie fan who can enjoy the little things in life again

'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' finds its charm in the little things. The story about Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is a modern day fairy tale and that is exactly how it looks the entire film. <br /><br />We have a wonderful story about Amélie who decides to help people around her, making them happy. Not by doing great big things or giving money, but by little things. She helps her father by making him believe that his gnome from the garden is on a trip around the world, she helps a lonely neighbor by just visiting him, she helps a stranger by returning something she found in her home. On the way she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) who's hobby it is to collect photos from automatic photo booths. Photos that were tossed away because people thought they didn't look good enough. He puts all those photos and pieces of photos in a big book. There is a little mystery in the book as well, of course I will not spoil that for you. The story is not only sweet and charming, it has some great moments of comedy as well.<br /><br />The movie looks colorful and bright almost constantly. Even the sad parts from Amélie's life, her youth for example, look almost strangely happy. In this world, Paris actually, Audrey Tautou is the perfect inhabitant. She has one of those faces that seem to smile the entire time. She looks like she just pulled a joke and she is waiting for you to find out what it is. In a way her character is really doing that here so it does not feel strange.<br /><br />In short 'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' is charming, funny, romantic bright and full of life. This is the perfect lighthearted movie.

Not a lot of movies create their own sort of universe. Some that come to mind include "The Wizard of Oz", "American Beauty" and "Vertigo." These movies are so distinct and original that they seem to have created there own spot in the universe, untouchable by anything else. You can add "le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain" to that list.<br /><br />Here is a film so original, so funny, and so warm that it left me with smiling for hours and the people on the sidewalk thinking I was crazy. Yes it is heart warming, but not in the phony Wal-Mart commercial sense; but in the sense of how good you feel when laughing with a dear, dear friend.<br /><br />The film tells the story of French waitress Amélie (Audrey Tautou.) She is in her early twenties, lead a gloomy childhood and is missing something in her life until hearing of the Death of Princess Diana causes her to drop the cap of a bottle which rolls along the floor and dislodges a tile on her bathroom wall. What she finds behind that tile leads her to the decision that she is going to do what she can to make the people around her happier by whatever means possible.<br /><br />Amélie goes about this with great success. One particularly wonderful scene shows Amélie helping a blind man across the street and rapidly describing what's happening around them to give him a picture of the world he doesn't get to see. This is only one in a mountain of selfless deeds she does to make people happy.<br /><br />As she continues enriching the lives around her, Amélie becomes challenged with the fact that if she only helps others anonymously, she may live her life alone and without the happiness she brings others.<br /><br />Amélie's conflict is what rounds out the picture and makes it complete. The movie is deep and takes Amélie's inner struggle seriously, but it's never heavy. Brilliantly hilarious, "Amélie" has a wonderfully funny script and is brought to life in visual splendor by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet ("Alien: Resurrection", of all things) and has at its center Audrey Tatou giving one of the warmest, most sincere and funniest performances you'll see this year.<br /><br />I can't tell you how much I love this movie. Just thinking about it gives me goose bumps and I can't wait to see it again. SEE IT IN THE THEATRE IF YOU CAN! This may be the year's best picture and is not to be missed.

I had heard superlative comments on this film and it does not disappoint.<br /><br />Paris is the backdrop and what a Paris, A Paris of La Boheme and the Merry Widow. Audrey is brilliant in the role of Amelie, projecting a true joie de vivre.<br /><br />The film is full of surprises in both plot and characters. I left the theatre feeling lighter. It is truly one of a kind, eccentric, unusual and uplifting. I will not say more on it as it would spoil the fun.<br /><br />I gave it a 10 out of 10 for something so completely out of the ordinary and so very unhollywood.

A slice of heaven right here on earth, "Amelie" is a joy to behold, and has some of the most gorgeous cinematography I've ever seen in a movie. <br /><br />Audrey Tatou is perfection as the title character. A combination of Audrey Hepburn, Dolly Levi and Roger Rabbit, she involves herself in the world surrounding her as a means of really enjoying living. There are moments when she finds complete and total joy just walking down the street. <br /><br />Some of it is hilarious, too..like when her pet goldfish habitually tries to commit suicide, or when she is on the telephone with the man at the porno shop, or when a character is asked "Are you a congenital shmuck"?<br /><br />But for the most part, its a human comedy, about love, of course.<br /><br />Just beautiful. 10/10.

The charming con men featured in this film have found that the easiest way to make money is to part fools from it. It's so easy, in fact, it's like shooting fish in a barrel--hence the movie's name. Excellent acting and quirky characterization make this flick really fun to watch. Dialogue is sharp and witty, with some truly memorable lines.

To start off with, I heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared. Sitting here, long after in the aftermath, I might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity. Eventually I did get around to see it, though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does, and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it, but I must say I have never been so wrong before. And I am happy saying it.<br /><br />This movies biggest crime, and yet its biggest asset, is that it is in French. Subtitles just does not bring full justice to a movie like this, and it is bound to scare off most of the audience not used to subtitled movies. Sad to say so, but I believe it is the truth. I do not know any French at all, but I sure wish I was fluent watching this movie!<br /><br />Compared to most other films "Amelie" (and I will stick to "Amelie" since "Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain" is a bit long to write) is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to, but it is given to us in a very special kind of way, mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details. We get to see and experience the world and especially Paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of Amelie, A Paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of Amelie.<br /><br />Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings to life the world of Amelie with colors, masterful camerawork and a few special effects (Well, I have certainly felt like melting a couple of times too in my life!). Some people I spoke to before seeing "Amelie" criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic, but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl. She just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest. Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to bring us along without losing control of the set or the plot. It is exactly this kind of movie that could easily be overdone and lose all of its magic in the hands of the wrong person, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet never slips a single time. For you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us "Alien 4" back in 1997, (I still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film...), and the wonderful "Delicatessen" in 1991.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou could not be overemphasized for her importance in portraying Amelie. I am a bit embarrassed admitting it but I was almost falling in love with Amelie myself, forgetting she was only fiction on the screen. However she does not carry "Amelie" solely by herself. The cast makes an excellent whole and it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting the whole outcome. Everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as Amelie herself does.<br /><br />I could go on forever about "Amelie". It contains so many details and switches in tempo and camerawork it has to be seen more than once to take in and understand everything. Damn it, "Amelie" made me happy, laughing out loud at times, and very few movies affects me like that.<br /><br />I very rarely give movies a 10, and I was indeed considering a 9 for a while, but for me this is one of those movies I will come back to time after time. Long after the CG thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget Hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten, Amelie will still be jumping around in my heart, doing all those silly and charming little things I wish I dared to do too...

Absolutely magnificent. Brilliantly written and directed--although most of the actual dialogue was cut out to make it a little less verbose. I guess that could be a good thing. All in all, exceptional. Especially the sex scenes. Totally classic Brode.<br /><br />-R

At first, this movie seemed like your typical Playboy film. Two sex scenes within the first 20 minutes, woo! But then things actually develop into this weird Hitchcock-esque story with multiple twists. All in all, however, the pure brilliance of the writing is ultimately ruined by the poor acting and subpar direction.<br /><br />Definitive Brode!

"Midnight Blue" is a rare case of a soft core flick that is interesting not only because of the sex scenes, but for the plot.<br /><br />Here the cinematography, acting, and even clothing looks very early 90's and that could be labeled as a negative point but when the story starts to develop and some of the sex sequences get steamier, you can truly find yourself enjoying it good time.<br /><br />It had been said that the Director uses some Hitchcock references and it's true but it's hard to use a solid plot on a film like this. Still, the result is more than satisfying.<br /><br />There are hot women, good sex, and interesting plot. This is a classic by all means.

"In 1857 a citizen of Great Britain (from the Channel Island of Jersey)" At least I do not think so.<br /><br />Jersey like the other Channel Islands is an Independent State otherwise, for example it would have the same income tax regime as applies elsewhere in the places Governed by the UK parliament which are currently England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, although in 1857 the whole of Ireland was under UK law.<br /><br />The film is nonetheless of interest apart from the error in the comment that I record.<br /><br />One wonders whether a better portrayal of a fascinating story would have been achieved with the lead played by a more natural actor, rather than the wife of the director. However, this rather stiff style is of it's age and so hardly surprising as it was not made in the times of Susan Sarandon or Meryl Streep.

This film has a very open ending - just as in the true case upon which the film is based you don't know whether or not Madeleine killed her lover, as the jury renders a uniquely Scottish verdict of "not proved" which splits the difference between outright acquittal and conviction. Such a film would have been difficult to make in America at the time, as the U.S. production code of the period so demanded clear villains and heroes and swift and sure punishment of the villains.<br /><br />There's a great use of lighting and shadow in this film, effectively differentiating the dark back-alley scenes where Madeleine meets her poor lover on the sly from those well-lighted ballroom and daytime scenes where she is courted by her family-approved suitor, William Minnoch. Ann Todd gives a very guarded performance here as Madeleine, and maybe that was necessary to add mystery to what and how she was thinking about her predicament.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed by Ivan Desny as Madeleine's backstreet lover, Emile L'Anglier. He reminded me a great deal of Orson Welles in his physical features and even some in his acting style. Desny's performance is also subtle, but not so subtle that you can't see that his character is more in love with the idea of becoming a moneyed gentleman again than he ever could be with Madeleine herself.<br /><br />This is one of David Lean's early films, and there is one scene in particular that reminded me of his last - "A Passage to India". That scene is when Madeleine is being conducted to court in a carriage accompanied by a police officer with the mob getting out of control outside. It's not just the alleged crime that has the mob stirred up, its Madeleine's rank and privilege as well. There is a similar scene in "Passage to India" as Judy Davis is conducted to court to testify. In that film it's her accusations of an Indian of the crime of attempted rape combined with her status as a member of the British aristocracy that has the crowds riled up. I wonder if Lean borrowed on the ideas from this film when making his last.<br /><br />At any rate it's worth a look, just don't expect things to be wrapped up neatly as they almost always were in courtroom dramas in American films of the time.

I had the great joy of watching David Lean's MADELEINE(1950)for the first time ever on TCM early this morning, and can say without any reservations that though it is one of the great director's lesser-known works, but it is by no means lesser in either acting or direction.<br /><br />Featuring the glacial blonde Ann Todd(then Mrs. David Lean) as the real-life accused murderess Madeleine Smith, the film skillfully portrays the travail a foolish and willful young woman goes through when she follows her heart instead of her head and gets ensnared in a sticky situation. Caught between her tyrannical martinet father, James Smith, played excellently by the great Leslie Banks with his paralysed profile which added an extra flourish to his cold unsympathetic manner and her charming but unscrupulous gold-digging French paramour, Emile L'Anglier played skillfully by Ivan Desny, Ann Todd's Madeleine is veritably "caught between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea!" It would seem that there is but one recourse for Madeleine, that of shutting two-bit Casanova and lothario L'Anglier up so that her fire-breathing dragon of a father does not bite her pretty little head off, in much the same way that I have enjoyed biting into pastry Madeleines! But the ambiguity throughout the film of whether Madeleine actually did the deed and put paid to her paramour is maintained even up to the end when Madeleine gives her leprous Madonna half-smile which could indicate either guilt or innocence, leaving it up for the viewing audience to decide on their own.<br /><br />The splendid direction of Lean, the superb moody photography of Guy Green contrasting various shades of darkness and light as well as interesting character studies of familiar character actors' and actresses' faces, the excellent film editing of Clive Donner(later to become a great director as well) and Geoffrey Foot, the authentic costume design of Margaret Furse all add to the moving drama. Jewel-like performances by such thespians as Barbara Everest as Madeleine's mother, Jean Cadell as Mrs. Jenkins the careworn landlady, Kynaston Reeves as a lugubrious Dr. Penny, Amy Veness as the sympathetic police matron Miss Aiken, John Laurie as the hypocritical Bible-spouting religious maniac and fanatic Divine rabble-rouser exhorting the crowd to condemn Madeleine, Edward Chapman as the worried Dr. Thompson, Moyra Fraser(more than HALF A CENTURY later, 55 years to be exact, in Dame Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer's "As Time Goes By" latest 2005 episode as one of the regulars, bumptious Penny, a role since 1993) as a spirited Highland dancer! Irene Browne as Mrs. Grant, George Benson as the Chemist, Eva Bartok as the Girl, Ivor Barnard as Mr. Murdoch, Anthony Newley! as Chemist's Assistant, Wylie Watson as Huggins, and many, many more, bear in mind that from Jean Cadell onwards, these were all UNCREDITED roles in Lean's film! They join with the credited cast Barbara Everest, Leslie Banks, Ivan Desny, Ann Todd, Norman Wooland as the ever-stolid and respectable William Minnoch, Madeleine's would-be-husband-to-be, Elizabeth Sellars as the harried but loyal pretty housemaid, Patricia Raine and Susan Stranks as Bessie and Janet Smith, Madeleine's younger siblings, Eugene Deckers as Thuau the unsympathetic French consul and friend of L'Anglier, and Barry Jones as the merciless Prosecuting Counsel. Last but not least is Hammer films stalwart and a superb actor, the late Andre Morell(husband of the late Joan Greenwood) as the Defending Counsel, who gives an impassioned and heart-wrenching yet cool and logical defense of Madeleine that has got to be one of the greatest courtroom speeches in Cinematic history! At least I think it is! The next time I bite into a pastry Madeleine I will recall Andre Morell's defense! <br /><br />All in all, a FIVE STAR ***** film rating for the actors' performances alone!

Enjoyed this 1950 true story about a young woman named Madeleine Smith, (Ann Todd) who lived in Glasgow, Scotland in 1857 and the story begins with the Smith family looking for a rather large home. Madeleine is very excited about a room in the basement of this house and I wondered just why she preferred such a location and of course the story will reveal the reasons for this decision. William Mennoch, (Norman Wooland) was an older professional man and was interested in Madeleine and wanted to marry her, but she kept putting off any discussions or decisions in this matter of marriage. However, the father and mother approved of William becoming their son-in-law. As the story moves along, you find out that there is another man that Madeleine is very much in love with and he is French and not very well off financially. This man's name is Emile L'Anglier and he was determined to climb into Glasgow's high social class and found that Madeleine and her family would be able to help him accomplish this task. This story holds great mystery in black and white and all the actors gave great supporting roles in this true story about a strange woman.

Excellent and unjustly overlooked David Lean film starring his then-wife Ann Todd, "Madeleine" is terrific drama, and perhaps one of Lean's best-directed films. Todd is the young Glasgow beauty Madeleine Smith, brought to trial in 1857, accused of murdering her lover by lacing his cocoa with arsenic. In sensational scenes, Madeleine was allowed to walk free, proved neither guilty or innocent through a lack of evidence. Lean takes an interesting approach with his subject matter here. The casting of Ann Todd, a blonde, glacial and enigmatic presence serves to be the director's strong point, as the ambiguity of Madeleine Smith's motivations are increased.<br /><br />Cinematographer Guy Green worked with Lean on the two Dickens adaptations before this film, and he once again shows absolute mastery of black-and-white images in this film. There are many strikingly composed shots in this film, not least the scenes between Todd and her lover, played by Ivan Desny. Madeleine hands him his cup of cocoa, and the shot is framed so the cup is in the foreground, alerting the viewer's attention and questioning Madeleine's motives as she focuses on the drink. At once we suspect her, knowing she has bought and used arsenic, but then doubt creeps back into our mind. Why would she let the young shop clerk and her maid both witness her buying arsenic, when it would have been much more clever of the woman to procure the poison by less public means? <br /><br />Another striking scene has Madeleine's tryst with her lover played out in the dark of night as she removes her shoes and dances to a Scottish song playing in the distance. At once Madeleine is free of the ties that bind her in the staid Victorian England, and her joyful, seductive dancing is inter-cut with rollicking, very physical scenes at the dance. Soon Madeleine is on the ground, losing her shawl. We fade to black, and Lean has very implicitly informed us about the nature of their relations.<br /><br />The acting is generally very good, with the leading players adding authenticity to their roles. Norman Wooland plays the wealthy, upstanding young man who courts Todd while she is still carrying on an affair with Desny. Elizabeth Sellars is also memorable as Todd's maid.<br /><br />Most historians believe the woman was guilty of the crime, as she certainly was in possession of arsenic in the weeks leading up to her lover's death, but Lean chooses to direct in a detached manner, and by the film's end we are still pondering "Did she or didn't she?". Todd gives a curious half-smile to the camera in the final close-up shot. Is it a smile of a woman who has survived a terrible ordeal, or the smile of a murderer?

I remember seeing "Firesale" on HBO in 1978. I was 15 years old. My friend and I laughed so hard we could not control ourselves. The details are so sketchy now which is sad, but I never forgot that movie. I don't understand why it never went anywhere and is now completely unavailable. This movie needs to be rediscovered. It would be awesome to see it again. Can anyone help? Can we contact Rob Reiner and get his copy? Ha Ha. There are so many ridiculously stupid movies. I have seen most of them. This is sad. Of all the movies to not be able to see, I wish it was'nt this one. Seriously, if anyone knows were to get a copy of this movie, please write to me. I would greatly appreciate it. thank you.

Ann Todd is "Madeleine" in this 1950 film directed by David Lean. The film also features Norman Wooland, Ivan Desny, Andre Morrell and Elizabeth Sellars. The film looks at the true story of the famous Madeleine Smith murder trial in the mid-1800s. Pressured by her upper class family to marry, Madeleine is in fact secretly intimately involved with a man from a lower class, L'Anglier (Desny) and has agreed to marry him. She doesn't want to tell her family, so she urges him to elope with her. L'Anglier was planning on marrying into the upper class lifestyle and insists instead that she tell her father (Leslie Banks) about their relationship. She can't, and believing that all L'Anglier wanted was her money all along, she breaks off with him and requests the return of her letters to him. She then agrees to marry William Minnoch (Wooland), who has been courting her.<br /><br />L'Anglier doesn't return her letters, and after she purchases arsenic, he dies of arsenic poison, having become ill at her house once before. Madeleine is arrested for murder.<br /><br />The film seems to follow the case quite accurately, but it's pretty cut and dried. There are some marvelous scenes - the two dancing in the moonlight is one, as an increasingly wilder dance goes on inside. The structure of the courtroom was interesting, as I had never seen a prisoner walk upstairs into the dock from what is almost a trap door in the floor. The view of all the faces looking down before she starts the climb gives an idea of what it's like to be put on trial.<br /><br />Ann Todd is a good actress, though an internalized one who comes off as rather cold. She was married to Lean, which may be the reason for her casting. At the time of the murder, Madeleine's father was displeased that she wasn't married, complaining that she had met many men but none of them have worked out. She was twenty when she took up with L'Anglier and 22 when she broke it off. Todd was 41 at the time this film was made. She was not carefully photographed and looked her age - way too old for this role. Andre Morrell is excellent as Madeleine's attorney. The rest of the performances are very good, with Banks a strong, intimidating father and Desny hinting at the slime that's below the surface of L'Anglier. Norman Wooland gives a charming and concerned performance as Madeleine's suitor, Minnoch.<br /><br />Lean's opinion of what happened is made very clear in the last moments of the film. Someone said the story needed Hitchcock's hand, but he was not successful with "The Paradine Case." There's something about these stories that is very detached and unemotional. Maybe Hitchcock could have cracked it; this early effort by David Lean doesn't quite make it.

Well that's odd, I thought as I picked up the June '98 issue of CMJ monthly. There's this ad in it for a movie called Shooting Fish with Kate Beckinsale in it (I love Kate Beckinsale... well did in the other two movies I'd seen her in before)with a soundtrack that's got music from Dubstar and Space and The Supernaturals and... Dionne Warwick. So anyway to make a long story short, I searched (in vain) for the soundtrack for nigh on a year but to no avail. Anyway, then one day I was at the video store (Major Video, before Blockbuster decided to buy that too) and I saw it and thought "Jaysis, there's something I need to see!" It had that snazzy-looking retro box, too, and I was in a happy mood, so I gladly went home and popped it in.<br /><br />This must have been the cheeriest movie I'd seen in years. It made me think of Bringing Up Baby it was so happy (and that's a good thing, by the way). Kate Beckinsale is absolutely charming, the American guy is lots of fun, and the English guy has the great sense to be charming AND insanely cute in that odd way that the British have. The movie has a plot, sure, but it doesn't matter. You should just watch it and be hap-hap-happy! Revel in the retro-kitsch set design and the goofy dialogue and that English guy's striped t-shirt. It's the best pick-me-up since Bounty (or, you know, whatever). (By the way, I warn you... after I saw it I caught myself singing that Dionne Warwick song for weeks afterwards.)

Madeleine is one of a number of costume dramas produced around the late 1940s to focus upon psychological conflicts from a female perspective. Other notable examples are Vincente Minelli's Madame Bovary and William Wyler's The Heiress, both released in 1949. However, whereas those two pictures were based upon great literary works from the 19th century, Madeleine is a dramatisation (I would imagine a fairly liberal one given its melodramatic style) of actual events.<br /><br />Director David Lean was always one to immerse the audience in the psychological states of his characters, often through use of attention grabbing shots and expressive use of sound. There are some fairly routine examples of this in the first half of the film  eerie shadows of Emile twirling his cane, the blaring bagpipe music of a village dance at Emile and Madeleine's secret meeting, and so on.<br /><br />Another of Lean's characteristics was that, in order to tell a full story, the narrative would switch between the multiple points-of-view. This can be done fairly easily with a director who treats the audience as a passive, externalised viewer, but with Lean's constant involvement of the audience it could occasionally give his films a disjointed, unbalanced feel. This is somewhat the case with Madeleine, which begins as a psychological drama in which a young woman from a strict household must choose between her heart's desire and loyalty to her family. About halfway through however the story becomes a murder mystery and eventually a courtroom drama, and the narrative fragments as we see the points-of-view of various witnesses to supposed crimes. All the psychological set-up of the first forty-five minutes becomes forgotten.<br /><br />In spite of the fragmentary nature of the whole, there are some strong scenes and the occasional touch of class here and there. The pivotal scene in which Madeleine's father discovers his daughters affair, while at the same time Madeleine learns of Emile's death shows Lean's dramatic staging at its best. Intelligent use of space and positioning of actors in this scene best shows off the varying reactions. The final scenes in court are a carefully constructed blend of points-of-view and reaction shots, and Lean's background as a renowned editor is in evidence.<br /><br />A great cast was often a hallmark of a David Lean picture, but Madeleine suffers from a lack of classy actors. Having said that Ann Todd, whom I don't normally rate that highly, is not too bad here, emoting well in close-ups. Apart from that the only standouts are Andre Morell in a powerful performance as the defence counsel towards the end of the film, and an unfortunately brief appearance from Scottish character actor John Laurie as a fanatical mob leader.<br /><br />Madeleine has its moments, but all in all is a bit of a mediocrity. Lean was at his best when he could go all out on the emotional drama, but this foray into the courtroom is simply not enough of one thing or the other to be a really strong picture.

David Lean's film Madeleine tells the true story of Madeleine Smith, a young woman from an upper-class Scottish family, who was tried for murdering her lover in 1857. The case, which was a media sensation in its day, ended with Ms. Smith being released after the jury reached the verdict of "not proved", which, in Scottish law, meant there wasn't enough evidence to convict her but sufficient evidence to entertain doubts about her innocence. The movie maintains the same ambiguity about her guilt or innocence of the crime, indeed ending with a voice over narrator asking the title character as to whether she was guilty or innocent. She just looks at the camera and gives a vague half smile that could mean either of the two.<br /><br />The strengths of the film are considerable. The lighting and overall cinematography give the film both a wonderful Victorian-era feel and a film-noir aspect as well. Indeed, the film has much in common with film-noir aside from the lighting. The story, like many noir films, has a dubious heroine who leads a fundamentally disadvantaged man, in this case, a lover from the wrong side of the tracks economically and socially, to his destruction. Indeed, given the situation presented in the film, the lover couldn't have realistically expected Madeleine's domineering and strict father to have ever accepted him given his poor social and economic prospects. Adding into the mix was Madeleine's own ambivalent handling of their relationship, promising one moment to tell her father about them, then pleading it was too difficult to do so. As history indeed bore out, it was a recipe for personal disaster.<br /><br />My main criticism of the film is that virtually nothing is told of how Madeleine managed to meet her lover in the first place. Some accounts I've read indicated that they first met in a Glasgow park. I think Lean should have shown that meeting to show how Madeleine had a mind of her own and how willing she was to defy her conventional and strict Victorian father. That would have added to the ambiguity of Madeleine's character, seemingly compliant to the demands of her family in terms of love and marriage and yet defiant of them as well.<br /><br />Still, the performances, especially Ann Todd as the title character, are top notch and this is a film well worth seeing. As I've said, this is the closest David Lean came to film-noir that I've seen.

To me, DF3 had the best plot of the 3 films, however the lack of Chuck Norris brought the intellectual achievement down. This movie missed Chuck's cool catch phrases, and his ability to shoot rockets out the back of his bike. This movie was somewhat of a disappointment, but overall, I still give it my approval. I would recommend it to someone who likes action, and wants to be entertained without all the glory of Hollywood superstars. When compared to other 3rd installments of trilogies, it still is up there with the best. Much better in comparison to the Godfather 3, and Die Hard 3.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />Don't submit to the man, fight the power!

The thin plot is weakened by poor acting and worse army skills. The soldiers combat in a hostile state shirtless, shooting only from the waist, never aiming, but always seem to hit the forehead. They never crouch or lie down for better aim, they rather stand up in clear sight. The Arab enemies never shoot from behind a shelter, they too are always standing up, usually in the middle of the corridors. The chase scene in the end of the movie is ridiculous. The Arabs send all of their vehicles to the same spot where they are all butchered at once. The interrogation scene in the airplane is preposterous, as the US army interrogates the terrorist with a pull-down screen, without the terrible noise of the engines sounding anytime. What a waste of time...

Delta Force 3 is your typical mindless action fest that you usually get stuck watching at 3:00 am on HBO when you can't seem to sleep and there's nothing on regular tv but news, infomercials and endless loops of Sportscenter. With this movie unless it's a real good case of insomnia your problems will soon be over...because for an action movie its pretty boring and the acting isn't anything to write home about either. Not to say it's horrible, it's really not bad...it's just not good either. It's one of those movies you watch and then you just kind of forget it eventually because it wasn't very memorable. I will say this about it though they did use a creative way to get the bomb in a tv studio.That was about the only memorable event in the whole movie.

Nick Cassavetes (Son of John), Mike Norris (Son of Chuck),Eric Douglas (Son of Kirk) star in this pointless sequel which finds them cast as gung-ho commandos who go to the middle east to keep a nuclear weapon out of terrorists' hands, along the way these commandos are aided by Russian commandos led by John Ryan (Not John P. Ryan) their mission goes well and they bring the terrorists down without breaking a sweat, which is why this movie is such a dud. One of the problems faced in Delta Force 2 was that Chuck Norris and his team seemed invincible and therefore the action was fairly one sided, in Delta Force 3 this is taken to an extreme level and therefore none of it is excited. Also the movie is poorly staged and cheaply made making it an embarrassing effort at best. Worst of all is that where as the first two had the coolness appeal of Lee Marvin,Robert Forster, Martin Balsam,Robert Vaugn, John P.Ryan, Billy Drago,Richard Jaeckel and (maybe) Chuck Norris, Delta Force 3's biggest name is Nick Cassavetes. Wow.<br /><br />1/5 Matt Bronson

"When You're in Love" is notable for two trivial reasons, neither of which brings any merit to the movie.<br /><br />The first trivium is that silent-film star Louise Brooks appears in this film as a chorus girl. In 1929 Brooks had poisoned her Hollywood career, refusing to participate in the re-shooting of one of her silent films as a talkie. Eight years later, trying to recover her brief stardom, Brooks was desperate enough to strike a one-sided bargain with low-budget studio Columbia: former Denishawn dancer Brooks would accept a chorus-girl role in "When You're in Love", at a chorus girl's wage and indistinguishable from any of the other chorus girls. Columbia would circulate photos of Brooks in the chorus line, hoping to drum up publicity for this film with the angle of the ex-star beginning all over in the chorus. The back end of this deal was that Columbia promised to give Brooks a starring role afterwards. The chorus-girl angle did nothing to save the box-office of "When You're in Love", and the starring vehicle never came.<br /><br />(I find Louise Brooks very sexy, but most of her fans seem very creepy. The Louise Brooks cult is determined to delude itself that Louise Brooks herself was identical to the character she played on screen. Most Marilyn Monroe fans are creepy too, for the same reason.)<br /><br />The second trivium is that "When You're in Love" is the only film ever directed by screenwriter Robert Riskin. Riskin was the principal scripter on most of Frank Capra's best films: most of the distinctive touches that define Capra's movies are actually Riskin's creations. When Riskin resented that Capra got all the credit for their collaborations, Capra suggested that Riskin should try to direct a film himself. This movie was it... and a very bad directorial debut. In his autobiography, Capra was openly gleeful about the flop of Riskin's one directorial effort.<br /><br />"When You're in Love" stars opera singer Grace Moore, which is part of the problem. Opera singers tend to be failures as movie stars. The success of Jeanette MacDonald was due much more to her sex appeal rather than to her singing voice. Ironically, one of the few opera singers to succeed in movies was Geraldine Farrar: a box-office hit in *silent* films. Grace Moore lacked Jeanette MacDonald's sex appeal and acting skills. Hedging their bets, the producers of "When You're in Love' have larded this film's score with music that's highbrow, lowbrow, middlebrow and everywhere else on the brow spectrum: some genuine opera, some operetta, some Jerome Kern. The most ludicrous moment occurs when Moore dresses up as Cab Calloway and sings 'Minnie the Moocher' with bowdlerised lyrics. It's not pretty, folks.<br /><br />The plot, you ask? Nobody sees a movie like this for its plot. Well, if you insist. Grace Moore plays a successful opera singer, who - as an implausible publicity stunt - gets married in name only. Her husband is a charming ne'er-do-well, played by Cary Grant. Guess what happens in the last reel. Go ahead, have a guess. It really irritates me to see movies about a woman who falls in love with a completely irresponsible jerk because he's handsome and charming. This happens in real life too, but I don't need to see it in the movies.<br /><br />"When You're in Love" is froth, utterly without substance. That's no crime, but the bubbles in this champagne have gone very flat indeed. I found this film tedious. Many of the musical numbers were extremely dull, and all of them were badly staged. Some character actors whom I've liked elsewhere (Henry Stephenson, Luis Alberni) give listless performances here. Robert Riskin was a brilliant screenwriter but this is one of his poorest efforts. Based on this one film, he shows absolutely no talent for directing, although perhaps he might have acquired the proper skills if he'd continued. (One of the greatest scriptwriters of all time, George S Kaufman, also directed only one film ... but Kaufman was a brilliant stage director.) I'll rate 'When You're in Love' precisely 2 points out of 10.

The sole directorial effort from Robert Riskin (the talented screenwriter behind many of Frank Carpa's best films), WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE is one of many films that attempted to re-create the success of 1934's surprise hit ONE NIGHT OF LOVE. This film boasts the advantage of featuring opera singer Grace Moore, the star of the previous film, in the lead role, yet it never really seems to amount to much and was not well-received by audiences upon it's original release. The film's basic premise (famous Australian opera singer "hires" an American man to pose as her husband in order to enter the country) is a workable enough set-up, but the picture fails to generate much momentum or interest. Riskin does a respectable job for a first time director, but displays a poor sense of pace and allows the picture to become plodding.<br /><br />Moore is acceptable as the film's Diva (she never really commands the screen, but she has a odd sort of like-ability) and Cary Grant is in fine form as her "rented" mate, but they are playing stock characters who only seem to behave in the manner that is necessitated by the script. Their relationship suffers numerous ups and downs throughout the course of the film, but I never really cared whether they ended up together and that is a serious determent for this type of picture. The film is also marred by far too many piecing musical numbers that seem to exist only to pad out the film's runtime and serve as a defacto showcase for Moore's shrill voice (even "Minnie the Moocher," which is often referred to as the film's highpoint, is virtually unlistenable). The film's true saving grace is Aline MacMahon in a fresh and intelligent performance as Moore's assistant - MacMahon's good-natured portrayal is a minor comic gem surrounded by a sea of mediocrity.

Another light hearted romp from the 30's. Who doesn't like Cary Grant? This is an early glimpse into the comedic side of the Cary Grant we loved in so many films he made afterward. Miss Moore lights up the screen with her singing. Grace Moore was an opera star from the Met that found her way into film. She was nominated for Best Actress for her 1934 film "One Night of Love". Here an Australian opera singer needs to get to America but cannot get over the border and agrees to a plan. This movie has quite a bit of charm. I love the scenes of Mexico. One song in particular is a bit overdone but, all in all this is a nice romantic film. It may not be Shakespeare but it's a lot of fun.

I really enjoyed this movie because I just sat back and listened. Dissection is no fun in film. This is a breezy romp rather than ART! I laughed and had a good time. I enjoyed Cary Grants early performance and adored Grace Moore's singing. Ailene McMahon was a regular Eve Arden pre the spunky Eve herself. The odd part is that Grace plays an Australian opera singer with her American accent while Cary Grant plays an American with his English accent. Miss Moore needs to find a way into the country since she doesn't have permission to enter the states. The border guards must have been much tougher in the 1930's! If you can get your hands on this film just sit back, relax and enjoy.

This is a really fun film with story and actors that make you feel their joy and their pain. I was surprised to catch pieces of this on cable, laughing so much that I had to look up the schedule to catch the whole movie the next time it was played.<br /><br />It was an intelligent movie with good intercharacter relationships. I really would like to find more movies by the writer/director Stefan Schwartz, but there doesn't seem to be anything recent on IMDB. The three main actors (Dan Futterman, Stuart Townsend and Kate Beckinsale) really seemed to enjoy working together on-screen.

The reason this silent film is still viewed today and enjoyed, is simply because the director of this film was Sidney Franklin who was a very famous director during the 20's 30's and 40's. His famous film was, "The Good Earth",1937, a story written by Pearl Buck, and received large audience attendance. Of course, Greta Garbo,(Lillie Sterling), looked very sexy and rather young and having an old looking husband, who was Lewis Stone,(John Sterling), who loved and adored everything about Lillie. Things go smoothly for a while in the jungle, but a two legged gigolo decides to have some fun with young and hot looking Lillie. It is great entertainment if you like the old time Classics and great acting and directors.

MGM had Greta Garbo quite busy making films during 1928 and 1929 as the studio saw the approach of sound film possibly destroying one of their top assets. Nobody knew what the outcome of Garbo's career would be at the time.<br /><br />Thus Greta Garbo made silents until 1930's "Anna Christie". This silent film is not really silent at all. It has a very sophisticated score for its time, including sound effects, crowd noises, and even singing during musical numbers, with long shots of the singers so you can't see that there is no true synchronization with the singers themselves.<br /><br />The story is that of 50ish John Sterling (Lewis Stone) and his young wife, Lillie (Greta Garbo). The two are embarking on a cruise to Java so that John can mix business with pleasure. His business is to look over some plantations that he may buy. The pleasure is his desire to hunt and shoot a tiger while in Java. On the boat the couple meet Prince De Gace, played by Nils Asther. John is by no means a neglectful husband, but at age 50 he has largely left his romantic days behind him. This makes Lillie a likely target for the charming prince and his silver tongue. He makes a play for her right off the bat, and continues his chase as the Sterlings remain guests in his home. Lillie is torn, but tries her best to avoid the prince and his advances. One night during their stay, after returning from a day of looking at plantations, John sees the silhouettes of the prince and Lillie on the drawn shade of the house just after the prince has grabbed her for a quick kiss. What will John do about this situation? The acting in this film is quite well done. Asther comes across well as the slimy but attractive prince, and Lewis Stone was a wonderful silent actor. His surprise when he first sees the couple in an embrace, and his look of both great disdain and knowing when he later sees the prince flirting with a servant girl says it all. Yet, like Garbo, some of his best performances would come with talking pictures where he could both artfully play the cad in the MGM precodes as well as Judge Hardy of the Andy Hardy series fame.<br /><br />Existing prints of this film are quite well preserved, and I highly recommend it for silent film enthusiasts.

While "Wild Orchids" is not a major classic, the film does illustrate the magic of the Silents at their peak. Within a few minutes, director Sidney Franklin establishes the vulnerable relationship between Lewis Stone, a businessman with an interest in commerce and hunting, and Greta Garbo, his younger and neglected wife. The couple embarks on a sea voyage to Java in search of tea plantations, and competition for Garbo's affection soon appears in the guise of an exotic prince. Stone's apparent and puzzling preoccupation with business over his beautiful wife is hard to fathom. Garbo could be described as Stone's trophy wife, and trophy she is. As garbed by Adrian and photographed by William H. Daniels, Garbo would be a prized trophy for any man or woman anywhere any time.<br /><br />Once aboard ship, with the same economy of style used to illustrate the marriage of Lillie and John Sterling, Franklin quickly sketches the character of Nils Asther, the Javanese prince. Garbo watches in horror as Asther whips a servant outside his cabin, and his dark eyes and pencil-thin mustache speak volumes. Although too pretty and occasionally fey to be totally convincing as a Lothario, Asther works hard at befriending Stone and seducing his wife. Unfortunately, Stone's indifference towards his wife only helps propel this film down a familiar road.<br /><br />The Danish Asther as the Javanese Prince De Gace is as Asian as the realm he rules, which was conjured in the frenzied minds of MGM's art directors. The welcome banquet is reminiscent of the feast in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom," but without the snakes and eyeballs. At one point, Garbo dons a local costume and, although she fails to charm her husband, she does presage her subsequent appearance, opposite Stone once again, as Mata Hari. Despite Asther's occasional lapses, the performances of the three leads are naturalistic. Stone is always solid and dependable, and Garbo, well, she is always captivating whenever on screen. While not among her greatest, "Wild Orchids" is vintage Garbo, representative of silent films at their best, and worthy entertainment.

This is not a silent film - this is an early sound film. Although there is no dialogue, the film has a continuous fully orchestrated score and sound effects. It is rather overlong and could have been trimmed by half an hour without any ill effects. Timings vary - Maltin times it at 102 minutes, the MGM/UA VHS box times it at 119 minutes, but my timing of the VHS itself within that studio release comes to 109 minutes.<br /><br />Garbo is married to an older man, Stone, who neglects her with business duties while on a trip to a tea plantation in Java. A Javanese prince sees his opportunity to seduce the bored Garbo and proceeds apace.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT - SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH. When Stone finally catches on, he manipulates the Prince into accompanying him on a moonlit tiger hunt, but first empties the Prince's gun of bullets.<br /><br />Garbo is most alluring and gives a first rate performance. Memorable close ups include: her reaction to the servant's whipping, a dolly in as the Prince is introduced to her, in her bed on board the boat. There are other well composed moments, most memorably when she is on her balcony at the palace at right of screen in a shaft of light - the shadow of the prince in the doorway is cast upon her and the camera slowly dollies in with the Prince entering the frame from left when he and the camera are upon her.<br /><br />The sound effects are numerous and well coordinated: traffic, crowd noise, ship's whistle, whipping, triangle dinner call, doors closing, train whistles, hand claps, insects/birds, gongs, gates closing, campfire voices, tigers growls, rifle clicks, rifle shots. There are also two sequences, one a chorus singing a title song, the other an elaborate (overlong and rather boring as well) presentation of native Javanese dancers, complete with a chorus, claps, calls, stomps etc. to illuminate the dances).<br /><br />It is certainly not Garbo's best silent but holds the attention for the casual viewer and is fascinating as an early sound film for the music and sound effects.

During nights scented with the perfume of WILD ORCHIDS, a Javanese prince woos the beautiful wife of a visiting American tycoon.<br /><br />Although really little more than a story about a romantic triangle, the excellent acting & superb presentation make this a very enjoyable film.<br /><br />Greta Garbo, exquisite & serene, shows once again that she was more than just a perfectly sculpted face. She was also a very disciplined actress who used her tightly controlled body to convey emotional depths and subtle nuances. Even in what for her was a rather minor film, she is a marvel to watch, beyond superlatives, exhausting all adjectives. She is simply Garbo and that is enough.<br /><br />For sheer exoticism, few Hollywood male stars of the period could compete with Garbo. Nils Asther was one of these. Although Scandinavian, something about the bone structure of his face made him ideal for Asian roles. He had already enjoyed much success as a matinee idol by the time WILD ORCHIDS was filmed. A fine actor, he seems loath to accede all of the viewers' attention to Garbo. (Swedes both, they must have had some interesting private conversations on the set.) Asther makes his characterization of the Prince a compelling blend of charm & cowardice - a creature quite capable of seducing his sultry costar into marital infidelity. The onset of talkies would prove difficult for Asther, his heavy accent making it hard for MGM to cast him effectively and he would eventually return to Sweden. However, when given the right role, as in Frank Capra's THE BITTER TEA OF GENERAL YEN (1933), Asther was able to exhibit the natural talent he was seldom called upon to use.<br /><br />Lewis Stone is the solid fulcrum over which his two extravagant costars teeter. While they exude passion & sensuality, he revels in the simpler virtues - duty, dignity, and, when he finally catches on to the Prince's depredations, righteous wrath. He manages to infuse all this with a quiet sense of befuddled humor, which only makes his character all the more human.<br /><br />The film's first rate production values make the heat & hedonism of Java come alive for the viewer. The Javanese dancing is of particular interest. The use of sound effects in this late silent film is of some significance - they perfectly illustrate where some film purists thought the cinema should remain: with music and effects, but definitely no dialogue.

This comment is intended as a guide to help people who have time to see only one movie about a dying grizzled athlete way past his prime to decide if they want to spend 94 minutes with Nick Nolte or 111 minutes with Mickey Rourke. (This is sort of like the late comedian George Carlin's famous routine comparing baseball to football; be warned, I still pick baseball.) On the basis of sports action, OFF THE BLACK is limited to ONE pitched ball--the TITLE pitch--while THE WRESTLER has many scenes of body-slamming, chair-bashing excitement. In terms of sex, Nick Nolte's character (Ray Cook) has prostate cancer and presumably the cuddling and kissing he does with his old high school sweetheart Marianne (a thankfully fully-clothed Sally Kirkland) is about all he's up to, while Mickey Rourke's Randy "The Ram" Robinson gets to spend a lot of screen time with topless Marisa Tomei (playing his exotic dancer lover Cassidy). In regard to substance abuse, Ray pretty much limits himself to a refrigerator full of beer, plus dinner wine and the occasional bottle of whiskey (contributing to the delinquency of a minor through promoting under-aged drinking with his 11th-grader surrogate son Dave Tibbel, played by Trevor Morgan), while The Ram seems to keep his life in shambles through over-medicating himself with every drug known to mankind. "Poignant" and "bittersweet" aptly describe both films, but the producers of OFF THE BLACK very obviously threw in a few crudities to obtain their desired "R" rating for a movie which could have just as easily been PG13, while THE WRESTLER is definitely a very "hard" R. For what it's worth, I rated the latter story one notch higher than BANG THE UMPIRE SLOWLY, at "9."

I loved the trailer for this movie because it looked interesting and funny.I really liked the 2 leads Nick Nolte and Trevor Morgan.They work really well together and I could easily see them working together in other movies.I liked the relationship they built.Ray was estranged from his own son for reasons we don't know and David looked to Ray as a father figure since his own dad couldn't be there for him because of a disability.It isn't uncommon for males to bond this way whether it be platonic or not.Throughout history older men have often had younger male companions.Unfortunately society nowadays has to put their ugly spin on it and make assumptions.Even in the movie David's younger friends ridiculed him about spending time with the older ump even though there was nothing happening except they were developing a friendship and Dave was like a son to Ray, and I think Dave looked up to Ray and respected him and later obviously really cared about him.The only problem with this movie I had was their relationship was over as quick as it began, and it seemed there was way too much more that had to be done and said.I agree with what another person said about why even mention Dave's mother since she wasn't even in the movie period.None of her absence made sense and wasn't explained well or explored at all.Also the 2 kids turned out remarkably well for having a disabled dad and being abandoned by their mother.I didn't find that believable.And then there was this whole back story about Ray's past that got thrown in and also not explored.If these missing characters were in the movie it would be easier to understand the characters better and understand how they ended up being so broken.I mean for Chris'sakes! something made them reach out to each other to have their needs met.It was ironic and comical how they ended up meeting.There were so many comical moments in this movie and played so genuinely funny I laughed hard.The reunion and the bullshitting was a riot and the look on Dave's face was priceless the more he learned about his new buddy.It also had it's serious side and was very realistic and this type of thing does happen.I know people who are living this. But like I said, it's a good movie but had potential to tell more and to go way deeper.

This 2006 film played in no more than 4 theatres in late 2006.<br /><br />It should have played in at least 1000 theatres across the country. The R rating it has gotten is incorrect,It really should be a PG 13.<br /><br />The F word is used a few times as an expression & there is one nasty sexual remark one teen ager makes to his buddy. THIS TO ME IS NO REASON FOR THE R RATING,.<br /><br />James Ponsoldt both wrote the screenplay & directed with much care.<br /><br />Nick Nolte one of our better actors gives the performance of his career as sick heavy drinking man, who has many problems.<br /><br />Trevor Morgan was not yet 20 when he did this film,he too is a troubled teen who is befriended by Nick Nolte after he does a bit of vandalism to Nolte's house. Young Mr Morgan will be an actor to watch for many years, This is not his first film BUT the reason is obvious why he got this plum role/ HE WILL BE A STAR.<br /><br />Timothy Hutton is Trevor's very silent & distant father. & is just excellent.<br /><br />Rosemarie Dewitt is charming as Trevors younger sister.<br /><br />In fact the entire cast is excellent,.<br /><br />HOWEVER PLEASE NOTE the film is slow moving, Please see this & stay with it,you will be rewarded & at the very end find out what the title means<br /><br />Ratings ***1/2 (out of 4) 93 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (OUT OF 10)

The third time is the charm for James Ponsoldt, writer, director and actor in a really touching indie film that everyone can relate to. Maybe that is why it died at the box office after a few weeks without really making it big. It's a story that we can all find a piece of ourselves in.<br /><br />Ray's life is in the crapper. he runs a junkyard by day and comes home to a house where he lives with an ugly dog and they both drown their sorrows in beer. He umps the local games and know that is just asking for trouble.<br /><br />After the local team loses their chance at the State playoff, he catches one teen who papers his house. This teen's mom has run off and his day is pretty much dead to the world. The two- Ray and Dave - hit it off and Ray becomes a surrogate dad, while Dave becomes a surrogate son.<br /><br />It's funny, tender, and sad. It will make you think about your own life and count your friends - or make some if you don't have enough.

James Ponsoldt is an impressive new talent whose gifts are well displayed in this very excellent small film, OFF THE BLACK. Ponsoldt is that rare combination of writer/director who has something unusual and significant to say and has the skills to tell his story with genuine sensitivity and with amazingly polished skill for one so new on the scene.<br /><br />In a small town anywhere in the US aging alcoholic Ray Cook (Nick Nolte) lives alone, spends his time making videotapes of himself in conversation with his son from whom he has been separated for years. He also is the umpire for the local baseball team, the pitcher for whom is a teenage lad Dave Tibbel (Trevor Morgan), a boy whose mother deserted her family leaving Dave and his younger sister Ashley (Sonia Feigelson) in the care of functionless distant father (Timothy Hutton), a man who would rather avoid any conversation or emotional support with his confused kids. Dave and two friends visit Ray Cook's house one night, empty trash on his lawn, scratch graffiti on his driveway and throw toilet paper streaming from the tree and TV antennae. Ray is sober enough to catch one of them - Dave - and makes a pact with the boy that he will not call the cops if Dave promises to clean up Ray's cluttered yard.<br /><br />Dave keeps his promise and gradually Ray and Dave warm to each other, each finding in the other the desperate needs to fill their empty lives - a 'son' and a 'father'. Ray convinces Dave to pose as his son at his high school reunion and the results of that experience coupled with numerous other incidents bond the two in one of the more tender love relationships ever captured on film. No, this film is not about physical attraction: it is about the kind of love that is a basic need in each of us and one that sadly is lacking in so very many lives today.<br /><br />Nick Nolte delivers a superb performance and it is refreshing to see him once again prove that he is a fine character actor. Trevor Morgan (at age 20!) is a revelation, that kind of actor who apparently excels in his craft intuitively. The supporting cast is likewise first class and the musical score by Claire Campbell, Alex Neville, and Brian Petway fits the film like a glove. Tim Orr's cinematography is so attuned to the story that it feels like the camera is another character. OFF THE BLACK is yet another little Indie film that came in under the radar and deserves so much greater an audience than it has had. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp

This movie is retro in everything. It is a lighthearted romantic comedy in the old mold, with two mismatched con-men, falling for the same girl, the dopey one eventually gets her, and his buddy gets the sister! While the plot is occassionally disjointed it never fails to keep moving along and is throughly charming along the way - helped greatly by the winning main characters. I was very surprised to see the mixed reviews, it is hard to work out what there is not to like in this thoroughly likable movie - occassionally clever, sometimes sappy, possibly a little predictable - but never unlikeable. As for the title, if you can't work it out, you don't have enough intelligence to be allowed out of the house by yourself. My vote 7/10 and a fun movie for some light-hearted entertainment. Definitely worth a watch.

Great story, very well written by James Ponsoldt. Whoever assembled the cast did a great job.<br /><br />It must have cost plenty as there are some well known names here.<br /><br />The interaction between everyone seems to flow perfectly. I can relate to some of the scenes in the movie from my earlier days<br /><br />at High School ( the toilette paper in the trees etc.) Nick Nolte should get recognition internationally from "Off the Black" as should Ponsoldt.<br /><br />Off the Black will do well at the box office if promoted. It has something of interest for everyone and is a GREAT story. I hope it does not get lost due to its lack of murder, overt sex, blood and gore. What this movie promises AND delivers is something teenagers and adults of all ages can relate to. Go see "Off the Black" and "Apocalypto" on the same weekend and I am certain you will feel better after the Ponsoldt Movie.

Really strong performances by all involved, especially Nick Nolte and Trevor Morgan. But it is James Ponsoldt's meaty script that is really thrilling. The depth of feeling he gets from his actors is good too. I wish he had more than 23 days to shoot, since some of the photography is marginal, but some shots are just beautiful, especially the close-ups of the actors' faces.<br /><br />Mild spoiler: This is a film of the human spirit, and human nature, and the nature of families: especially ad hoc families. And it has one of the most subtle uses of a female character in recent memory (the character Debra).

I enjoyed this movie. Nick Nolte gives his all and Trevor Morgan, as his reluctant protégé, gives a nuanced performance. Above all, I found OFF THE BLACK believable. The premise is a bit unlikely, but the actors are up to the challenge and the director knows where to take the story. It's not an expose of rural life, but it's not an exercise in sentiment, either. There are no set-pieces, one-liners or explosive confrontations, but there are truths. This is not one of these movies which focus so much on the negative as to numb the viewer. (I can name about ten movies in the last five years which do that.) But it does insist that life isn't perfect. The world of movie distribution isn't perfect either, which is why this didn't appear at the multiplex. But the DVD is there. Grab it.

Here's my disclaimer: I am related to someone involved in the film, so I'm not completely unbiased. Having said that, I saw the preview at Sundance and I thought it was a great movie. The beginning really conveys a sense of how painfully disconnected and lacking direction Dave Tibble (Trevor Morgan) is. As the film progresses Ray Cook (Nick Nolte), in contrast to Dave's father (Timothy Hutton), shows Dave that whether or not you are completely successful the only way to really live life is to engage with its issues, without self-pity. The cast was all excellent, especially Nick Nolte; he was awesome in in this role. The conclusion of the film is bittersweet yet hopeful.

I attended the East Coast Premiere of "Off the Black" at the Woodstock Film Festival. Having greatly anticipating seeing this film since I'd first heard about it over a year ago, and knowing a bit about the story as well as the cast and crew, my expectations were admittedly a bit higher than usual. Yet I tried to put away any preconceived notions I'd developed over time. I walked in with a clean slate. And not only was I not disappointed, but I was actually somewhat shocked. The experience of seeing "Off the Black" did what very few films have done this year; it left me with a tear in my eye and a smile on my face. I sat through over 30 films in Toronto waiting for that happen, and it did, just once. This was my first film here at Woodstock and it got me good.<br /><br />Within seconds, literally, we are introduced to young Dave Tibbel (Trevor Morgan). He's standing on the pitcher's mound, sweat beaded on his brow, studying the catcher's signals. His face completely fills the screen, as if the director is saying, "here you go. If you don't like what you see, this will be tough for you. If you do, sit back and watch the story develop." The story is that of a relationship between Dave and someone else, of course. But that someone is no blonde bombshell or voluptuous vixen. The other half of that relationship is Ray Cook (Nick Nolte), the ump standing behind home plate. But this is not "Brokeback Baseball," no, although surely that may enter your mind. It's something else. It's something rarely explored in American cinema, and it's bold and daring. It's a love story -- a good old-fashioned romance between two individuals who just happen to be male, and it's totally platonic. "Is this possible?" you may ask. It sure is, and "Off the Black" will prove it to you.<br /><br />This film is made with passion and care. The soft, natural lighting of the interiors allows the full mystery of the characters to flourish. Single point lighting allows interplay of light and shadow which echoes the bright and dark sides of Dave and Ray, as well as the family members who surround them. Dave's father Tom (Timothy Hutton), withdrawn and distant. Sister Ashley (Sonia Feigelson), on the cusp of adulthood, gawky and afraid. All have secrets to tell, but don't, or won't, or can't. Cinematographer Tim Orr manages to find beauty in every little thing -- contrails, dripping gutters, siding and eaves and gently sloping roofs. And the countryside -- oh my. The lush scenery of the Catskills is indescribable. As Ponsoldt pointed out in the Q&A after the screening, the setting is supposed to be his Georgia home. But it could be anywhere where sea and sky and small towns predominate. Some of the shots are literally breathtaking. I found myself gasping several times. But what tugged at my heart even more was the sparse, almost homespun soundtrack. Punctuated by the occasional train whistle in the distance, the music never distracted, never shouted, "this is important." The contrast between the beauty of the setting and the ugliness of the fractured individuals who populate it is stark. It is on this canvas that writer/director James Ponsoldt, in his first feature, crafts a work of art that is simply one of the most poignant love stories imaginable. Those who've read my comments before know that I dislike traditional reviews because they invariably give too much away. It's easy to find a synopsis of the film so I won't do that here. But in many love stories, the protagonists meet, get tangled in tension and deception, and finally fall in love. Occasionally that's followed by breakup and tragedy. Those aren't my words -- they are those of Ponsoldt in the Q&A after the film, who said that he actually wrote the film as a romantic love story. It just happened to be played by two male actors and is platonic.<br /><br />To be honest, the film can be hard to watch at times. Nolte's portrayal of the seldom sober Ray is unsettling and painful, like a bad toothache that you can't wait to be pulled. Morgan's sensitive, vulnerable, sad-eyed Dave is like a puppy cowering beneath Ray's rolled up newspaper. But the bravado falls away on Ray's part, the sarcastic self-confidence and humor emerges from Dave, and the boy who needs a father draws closer to the man who needs a son. Finally, what makes this film so joyful to watch is the interplay between the two. It is all so natural that it seemed unscripted. As it turned out, much of it was. In reply to my question during the Q&A regarding how much was improvised, Ponsoldt not so surprisingly admitted that he gave free reign to Nolte and Morgan quite often, and some of the best lines in the film were theirs and theirs alone. And only the best directors are willing to step back and let that happen. And only the best actors can pull it off. Most will not be surprised at Nolte's performance -- he is, after all, a veteran if there ever was one. But "Off the Black" could be the vehicle which puts Trevor Morgan on filmgoers' radar, if it's not already. I'd seen his work before (He was Ponsoldt's first choice, largely based on his performance in the indie classic "Mean Creek"), but he carries this film so confidently and easily that I left the theater shaking my head in wonderment. And a tear in my eye and a smile on my face. "Off the Black" will do that to you.

Adaptation of James Graham's western book plays like a leftover second-feature from the 1940's. Robert Mitchum is very likable playing a machine-gun toting "priest" who, along with two criminals, is cornered into an assassination plot in 1920's Central America. Curious combination of cheeky asides and formula bloodshed takes a good while to jell; director Ralph Nelson appears to be attempting a quirky approach, but he doesn't go far enough with his dark-humored take. However, the pacing does pick up after a draggy first hour, and the supporting players are interesting. Rita Hayworth, cast as a sympathetic Senora, makes her final screen appearance. ** from ****

Very enjoyable. This is a very good Western. This movie is a must see for fans of the genre or of Robert Mitchum. I was never able to find this movie on video let alone DVD. My favorite aspect of the movie is the little boy who trails Robert Mitchum throughout the movie. I believe that the movie would have been even better if this relationship had been emphasized more. This is especially true when you consider the climax of the movie which is left a little wanting because of this lack of relationship. Nevertheless, I was still moved at the end. What a cute kid! Wise and unusual choice for Hollywood to pick a Mexican child actor for the part.

To some extent Ralph Nelson's "The Wrath of God" spoofs westerns, but like Nelson's "Lilies of the Field," under the comedy is, I think, a deeply felt belief in divine grace. Both movies focus on unlikely human materials having a vocation they fail to recognize and consciously resist. Herein, Robert Mitchum plays a con man masquerading as a priest and a Catholic martyr in the tradition of Thomas à Becket or Thomas More mistaken by many as a hedonist.<br /><br />In her last screen performance Rita Hayworth has preternaturally red hair (fire-engine red, not a color of any natural human hair), few lines, and is required to look devout (which she manages to do). As her flamboyantly traumatized and traumatizing son, Frank Langella gets to chew up the scenery, which he does with great relish (before "Dracula," after his memorable film debut in "Diary of a Mad Housewife" and Mel Brooks's adaptation of "The Twelve Chairs"). Ken Hutchinson does fine as the token normal guy who is embroiled in others' plots, including the romantic subplot that involves him with a mute Indian maiden (Paula Pritchett). In a Sidney Greenstreet-kind of role as a corpulent and corrupt gun-runner Victor Buono is suitably droll. Still, it is Mitchum's movie, and he is as compelling when he takes his priestly role seriously as when he plays the usual disengaged but competent existentialist who expects nothin' from nobody. <bt><br> A motley gang of foreign mercenaries getting involved in the confusions of the long-running Mexican revolution and taking a side against their financial interest recurred in a number of late-1960s and early-70s movies, including "The Wild Bunch", "The Professionals", and "A Fistful of Dynamite." The latter two use considerable humor within the genre of expatriates taking sides (which in Mexican settings of different eras includes "Vera Cruz", "Old Gringo", and "Bring Me the Head, of Alfredo García").

Not everyone agrees that this a parody. I have read that the film turned out confusing because of problems on the set. Including, Rita Hayworth's Alzheimer's and an actor who had a part for the first six weeks of filming. He was severly injured and couldn't complete his part properly. Therefore the confusion. Everyone wanted to just forget the whole thing but they released it anyway. All wasn't lost however, I personally found it very unique and intriguing. And as a Mitchum fan a rare, wonderful find on the classic movie channel.

Remarkably funny western/revolutionary action pic stars Mitchum as a con artist who poses as a priest and Langella as the South American' dictator he and his friends have been blackmailed into assassinating. Hayworth appears briefly as Langella's tormented mother. <br /><br />The action is fast and well staged, and the film's humor is so effective that it has often been seen (mistakenly, I believe) as a spoof of its genre, rather than as the fine example it is of the genre at its best. This whole line of reasoning bothers me, because it implies that an adventure movie can't be funny, that it has to take itself deadly serious. Much like "Duck, You Sucker!" this film's irreverent humor is one of its main ingredients, but it does not detract from its standing as a decent action flick. It's in fact closer to the way action pictures are made today -- I would question whether the critics and fans who see this as a "parody" also think that Schwartzenegger's "Commando" and "The Running Man" are also parodies?<br /><br />As Mitchum's character becomes more involved with Langella's peasant village, giving them the sacrament because they haven't seen a priest in years, he begins to BECOME the priest of his con-game, but his actions keep his friends and Langella guessing as to the extent of his "conversion." This brings up the theme of the appearance becoming the reality, an unusual theme for a western action flick. <br /><br />Good performances and an unusually good film results.

This movie was so funny and entertaining... The actors were great, especially Stuart Townsend. It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The funeral scene was very funny. The scene where two of them were sitting on the roof was so romantic. I can watch this movie over and over again.

I love this trailer, brings me back to the horror movies of the 70's and early 80's. Films like Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Children of the Corn, Halloween, films that had a lot of memorable villains were so much fun to watch. I don't like a lot of the new horror movies today like Hostile, The Descent and a lot of the films that Lionsgate puts out. There is so much over the top, icky, gross violence. Watching this preview, I felt like a little kid in the theater again. Even the actors kind of have a nostalgic look to them. Actor David Morwick reminds me of Tommy of Eight is Enough who I had a huge crush on. She, (Vigdis Anholt) reminds me of Glenn Close from Fatal Attraction - fun stuff!

I know one of the actresses in this film but I don't think I'm biased because I've told her when she doesn't pick the greatest projects lol.I saw this at the DGA theater in NY and I'll be completely candid about what works and what doesn't work in this movie. What didn't work for me was some of the editing/pacing. There were one or two scenes that dragged bit - the first guy that was killed in the forest plus why didn't he say anything? The other scene I wasn't crazy about was the guy wandering around aimlessly with clippers - what was the point of that? Wasn't all that crazy about the performances of Peter's friends. Here is what does work and quite well. The photography in the movie is exquisite. The color red really jumps out at you. The sound track is to die for, especially since it is an original score. I've read other reviews on here where people say this is some of the best art work they've seen. They are absolutely right. There are some very powerful performances here. Three come to mind. The woman who plays the teacher, Liz Callahan is an absolute pro. The guy who plays Peter, David Morwick is also great. He's got the natural stuff. Erin Merryweather played by Vigdise Anholt is one scary villain. She nails it. Knowing that this was low budget and not done by a studio, it blew me away watching it in the theater. This belongs on the big screen. Also, I've heard the ride to finish this film was a tough one particularly for the filmmakers so they have my respect for seeing it through. The good definitely outweighs the bad and that is why I give a ten.

One of the great things about the internet having become a semi-official film distribution channel is it giving people the chance to view films they never otherwise would have had a chance to see, particularly first time film-makers and those trying to make a name for themselves.<br /><br />Little Erin Merryweather would fall into that category for me. I have no idea how writer, director and actor in this piece David Morwick, feels about his film being available in the high quality divx format on the internet, but maybe he should be glad, as it will create an audience for his work it's unlikely he would have had any other way.<br /><br />With the constraints of first time film making, especially lack of experience, it is always good to focus on the positives in reviewing these films. You will of course expect mistakes and it is a measure of the films success in how far the positives outweigh the negatives.<br /><br />Little Erin Merryweather succeeds abundantly in scoring positives.<br /><br />Already mentioned in its reviews here are its art work and photography, they're beautiful. Beautiful photography is always an asset to good story telling and in this case, along with the art work, ties in especially well with the theme of the fairy story within a story.<br /><br />That theme itself is another plus for LEM. The genre is turned on its head by it's rewriting of Little Red Riding Hood and I like the idea that that was played with. Also clever was the fact that the film doesn't allow it's self to be neatly categorised into any one genre, and that too is a strength that lends originality.<br /><br />All in all (and given that it had just turned midnight on Halloween!) I enjoyed watching LEM. However there always has to be negatives in criticising too! What puzzles me with LEM, given how much Mr Morwick got superbly right for a first film, is that it's actually quite silly things that let him down.<br /><br />The policeman and his intervention was very, very unrealistic. I realise there were budget constraints, but if a serial killer has killed three people in three days, there will be more than one police officer involved, who will not just be sharing information with a college lecturer.<br /><br />A small point maybe, but it made the last twenty minutes of the film seem more contrived and the eventual denouement a bit silly. I think he could have waited until further into the film before Erin's identity were revealed and that would have helped maintain tension for longer. If I had to sum up LEM's flaws, it would be that if explored just a bit more deeply, it's story would have had a great deal for nuance and subtlety to give up and that it would have elevated the film from excellent to something really special. Where Mr Morwick scores B+ here, you feel he definitely has the potential for A's.<br /><br />Still, given its freshness and originality, I'm glad I spent the time with Little Erin Merryweather; it has a lot to recommend it.

I have to say I was surprised by how great the movie was. The artwork just blew me away, and I was trying to figure out if I could get in touch with the artist to do some illustrations for a book I'm writing. But I digress. The movie really impressed me. They went back to the roots on this one and did their magic with mood and acting as opposed to blasting the audience with monied tricks. It built tension the good old fashioned way, through people and their interactions (by far the most interesting in world).<br /><br />The movie pays attention to story, something that seems lost on Hollywood big budget productions this way. It's the reason film festivals are the place to go for people who love movies. I saw that Little Erin Merryweather won the Woods Hole Film festival, which is an up and coming festival. I can see why. I highly recommend it.

New York, New York Film Fr.Pan.<br /><br />New England is the physical and psychic backdrop for LITTLE ERIN MERRYWEATHER, a stunning film that manages to be both cerebral and terrifying. For anyone who has watched American horror films over the last thirty years, this is no mean achievement. Most of the bumper crop consists of cheap thrills, bad acting, laughable dialogue, gloriously nihilistic exsanguination scenes that mean nothing and only signify an audience as banal and boring as these slash-and-gash films. Prepared for the horror equivalent of a Brecht play: it will transform the audience and expectations about what the genre can do when it is permitted to move beyond its creaky conventions.<br /><br />Vigdis Anholt plays Erin, a college student with a dark past, and even darker secret, whose existence is neither quite lived in reality or within the fairy tales she writes. She moves through these thresholds with dreadful consequences and the mental geographies she travels soon moves her beyond the human. Well, this may not be entirely true, and my ambivalence about commenting about her transformation has as much to do with Anholt's acting as much as the well-crafted script. In one of the most nuanced acting performances of the past few years, Anholt demonstrates how long we've been waiting for an innovative character in the horror genre. Her ability to make herself vulnerable and wicked simultaneously is moving (not typically an adjective one attributes to actors in horror films); finally, a feminine embodiment of accidental evil who is active, not passive, empowered and completely sui generis. A performance worthy of a Bergman actress. Her excellence is complemented by the rest of the cast, most notably David Morwick, as Peter, the student who removes the cloak of evil and rids the world of one of the most memorable characters you'll meet (should we applaud or scorn him for this job well done? Moral ambiguity towards murderers is inevitable in this case). Morwick, amid many solid performances, is the most natural; the character inhabits him and his sensitivity reflects a fine-tuning of the young adult roles that so often become overacting, oversexed, overkill all too often. So we have a killer possessed by family demons and a male lead possessed by his character: let's be thankful that there are no exorcism scenes.<br /><br />I saw this film at the New York City Horror Film Festival and was overwhelmed by my viewing. The rest of the audience would concur, or so their gasps, nervous whispers, and intermittent screams would infer. The French philosopher Pascal once wrote of his fear of open spaces. The Director of Photography Michael Marius Pessah should be complimented for inflecting his widescreen vision with a tension and force that suggests terror thrives in the open air, not just in tight, dark pockets. Agoraphobics take warning! David Lean's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA comes to mind as a reference point; in each, the camera's wide-scope takes on a life all on its own, as if it were itself a character in the action. LITTLE ERIN MERRYWEATHER is a refreshing example of the industriousness of small-budget films graced with acting chops and intelligent writing. Go see it and prepare to be surprised, terrified, and delighted.

Jillian Christopher-Smalley -New York<br /><br />Recently I went to the New York City Horror Film Festival, which caught my interest as a contributing writer for a cultural magazine. The only screening worth mentioning was an independent film, Little Erin Merryweather. The festival leans towards the usual horror mold (soaking wet bloody scenes, torn limbs and headless corpses without regard for plot and presented in a way that borders on exhibitionism). After ten minutes, these films quickly lose their flavor. The last film screened at the festival, Little Erin Merryweather, renews the hope that creativity is still flourishing in the independent film world. It is a classy horror/thriller with numerous elements that work so well together. The excellent cinematography and choice of locations alone set this movie apart from the others. The impressive scenery here might well set a new standard and trend for future horror films. Whimsy gothic-like artwork is artfully woven into the fabric of the storyline. The music score, with its haunting leit motif, is impressive in both its professional composition and execution. Perhaps what astounded me most about this film was the naturalness of the actors, most notably Vigdis Anholt and David Morwick. Anholt and Morwick click on screen as a dynamic duo. Anholt, as Erin Merryweather, is a bewitching red riding hood who casts a spell over wolfish college boys. Liz Callahan is another well-trained actor who turns in a great performance as the college professor. Clearly these actors are not the run-of-the mill screaming victims. Unlike the usual horror hackers with high body counts and no character development, the characters and storyline in Little Erin Merryweather are well developed and fit uniquely into a script that really works. Also, a female serial killer assuming the role of a fairy tale character is not exactly the typical flat formula used in the horror films I have seen. This a creative film that gives the horror genre some spice. It is in a class of its own. Keep your eye out for this one!

Just thought I'd add to some of the comments here, having seen "Erin Merryweather" in New York. This is an amazing film, beautifully paced and really quite spooky. The cast is top-notch (rare for an independent film with no big "stars"), particularly the two leads, Vigdis Anholt (who plays the title role) and David Morwick (Director, Screenwriter and Producer as well as co-star). First of all, "Erin" is lovingly shot, the camera work is fluid and inventive, and much of the story is told through some of the best (and creepiest) fairy-tale artwork I've seen. The original score - at once sad, foreboding and apocalyptic - complements the tone nicely. Can't say enough about this film, but it certainly didn't fit with some of the DV "slasher" stuff I saw at the rest of the festival. If you see this around, check it out.

It's nice to see an indie film use an actual orchestra and choir rather than capitulate to the compromised sounds produced by computers and synthesizers. The film's score is not only brilliant in its composition, but equally impressive in its execution. From the opening credits to the chilling end of this film, the music proves to set an appropriate and fitting backdrop from scene to scene. Cristo, the composer, delivers us a score that juxtaposes beautiful sweeping lyrical melodies and hauntingly disturbing music. The inter-play between beauty and beast in the score reflects well both the killer's internal struggle between the forces of good and evil as well as the struggle that ensues between the disturbed killer and her innocent college-aged victims. The choir, magnificently harmonized and blended, is reminiscent of the 'Omen' in its 'hair-raising effectiveness,' but nevertheless maintains its own uniqueness in composition. The composer could be compared to venerable John Williams or perhaps a modern day Tchaikovsky for his orchestration. I don't know if the movie has been released yet, but I would highly recommend finding a release of the score on CD. I believe this film comes to us from Boston. If anyone has more information about the filmmakers, I would appreciate hearing back from you.

Well, my friends and I saw this film at the Woods Hole Film Festival and found it to be very interesting. A lot of the local stuff that showed there was only so-so but this one really stood out for us - first of all there were tons of people waiting to get in to the screening dressed like the film's major characters (particularly Erin) which surprised us. The film itself was really well-shot and the story and acting were a cut above what we were used to seeing at festivals. I'm sure other postings already hit on this, but the score was amazing and the cinematography really stood out - lots of interesting colors, some desolate wide shots and really inventive camera angles. Keep in mind this is a twisted and sad fairy tale, not a straight-up horror film, but it manages to be fun, campy, really dramatic and pretty eerie all in 90 minutes. It certainly deserved the Best Picture award it got there - we're waiting now to see it in a proper theater!

The plot isn't bad: A 'Little Red Riding Hood' serial killer stalks men (for an idiotic reason, you'll find out by the end) on a New England college campus, stabbing them to death and filling their stomachs with stone. Unfortunately, it was pretty much done (in the reverse) with the French slasher 'Deep in the Woods' a few years prior. Mix that with some 'Don't Look Now' and every other college slasher ever made, and you have your story. Regardless of its originality, I still thought it could be a cool idea. . . but it's the execution that ruins it.<br /><br />The actors all seemed to be 'come as you are' kinda people. The director obviously didn't expect them to dress acceptably, or shave, or look good. . . or know how to act. But, hey, there's only so much you can do with a shell of a script, so I'll try not to blame the actors too much. I mean. . . the writer had the people rhyming. If I wanted rhyming, Dr. Seuss is the way to go. The gore and violence seems to be mostly composed of gurgling sounds, shy cameramen, and fake blood in bicycle pumps. Isn't that what we horror fans always look for in a good slasher? (Please note sarcasm.) The direction and cinematography attempts to be artsy, but ends up just plain dumb. And there were parts where I actually laughed out loud at the camera-work. For instance, in a library conversation where the cameraman seemed to forget where he was supposed to be pointing the camera, so he just jerked it to one side and, I assume, hoped no one would notice. But, if you don't notice, I suppose you should exchange braille for films.<br /><br />In the end, ignoring all of the poor technical aspects of the film, it's still watchable and may be enjoyable to fans of the normal 'teen/college' (though many were way, WAY above teen and only pretending to be young) slasher flicks. . . and, while it does have a bit more intelligence to it, it's simply not enough and it only hampers the enjoyability of the film. The one thing the film did have going for it is a good amount of suspense. But, the suspense is quickly ruined for it when you realized there is absolutely NO mystery at all throughout the entire film. I mean, we saw the killer's face numerous times, and yet we were still supposed to be trying to figuring out a mystery? Don't think so. Suspense & Mystery, in a film like this, should usually go hand in hand. But if you can't utilize both, try to at least master one and just kinda hint at the other.<br /><br />Overall, the film is less-than-mediocre, which (for me) is the worst thing a film can achieve. Make it awful and infamous, or make it good and famous. Mediocrity is not memorable.<br /><br />Final Verdict: 3/10.

I really like this movie. It is a very clever movie and has a great sense of humour. I can't compare it to any American comedy. This kind of humour is completely different. This movie is for those who want to use their brain while watching and not only laugh. I really like European cinema and this movie as well as Run Lola Run prove that European cinema can go on. 10/10

I saw this film at the Woods Hole Film Festival in Falmouth, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. If I remember correctly, I believe this movie walked away with the award for best picture, but what I remember most was that this film had some of the best original artwork I have seen. I am truly not exaggerating when I say that. The movie is about a female serial killer who is an artist and is acting out the murders that she paints and illustrates in this book she is composing. (very neat idea by the way... and very creative and original way to tell a story) I thought the story line for this movie was very creative, especially for this genre. So the movie is a framework for the book and I don't know if the book is available to buy. It is absolutely amazing and I would love to get a copy. As a rule, I am not fond of this genre (the horror genre). I was definitely the oldest member of the audience, sitting in a theater amongst rowdy young people. This people definitely speaks more to the younger generation. Nevertheless, besides the outstanding artwork, there are some spectacular snow covered locations worth seeing. There is also a group of talented young actors. Vigdis Anholt, who I discovered is from Norway (I though I detected an accent) as well as David Morwick (a former model for Talbot's) and Brandon Johnson (who got his start on a soap opera) are all great. But I have to say that the performance I was most impressed with was Liz Callahan who plays the teacher. It's nice to see a strong female who doesn't die at the end of one of these films (oops...sorry to give away the ending for those who haven't seen it). I don't like to even sit through this type of movie, but if I happen to catch it on t.v. in the future, I'll watch it with the lights on and one eye open to see that amazing artwork again. The only thing I would say is that this film is a little too smart and sophisticated for its genre. If I were the filmmakers, I would not market this film as a horror, but rather a thriller. If you're a hard-core horror buff, this movie will go over your head. I think that a lot of these die hard horror fans want more in the way of blood, very little story and women that are undressed or have little or no character development. But, I shouldn't be going on too much because the film world is something I know very little about considering I'm a third grade teacher... So, if the filmmakers read this- guys don't be offended. You did a superb job. This teacher gives it an A -Mary-Rita from Salem, NH

There is the sweet smell of success with the movie Little Erin Merryweather. This movie opened to rave reviews at the New York City Horror Film Festival. All the stars are aligned. There are good-looking young actors, a fresh story, a new character in horror and a memorable sound track. This is an ambitious film with a lot of pop culture and cult status seems assured.<br /><br />The movie creates a new chapter in horror with its strong feminist theme. Add to that an eerie premise which revolves around young men in jeopardy. One might see this directly from the movie i.e. a scene where the three young men are watching our villainess, the lady in red, pass by them on a college campus. The more brash teenage boys sort of jeer at her as if to say that she has no problem picking off boys that seem to be gruff and tough whereas one of the main characters, Peter, has the virginal strength to fight her off.<br /><br />It may be why Peter and our villainess Erin connect. This movie may also be about the strength of the repressed. Unlike a lot of other slashers, it is interesting how these victims are portrayed. They are typical college kids. No one is a star vying for an academy award and the performances are all the more absorbing because of that. Instead of a high body count the victims are people that the audience comes to care about partly because the script is smartly set into the normsville of everyday life. When it seems more normal and accessible to the audience, they can relate to it. Then all of a sudden you find that what is supposed to be normal college life can become very threatening and scary.<br /><br />What's nice about this movie is it follows a basic rule of thumb- it's not what you see but what you don't see that is scary. It is the anticipation of knowing what's going to happen but not knowing exactly where and when. It also builds and builds and as time goes on the audience gradually gets a closer look at the villainess in a frightening immobilized doll's mask. The villainess is deftly played by Vigdis Anholt.<br /><br />Anholt, Morwick, Callahan and Johnson all bring in strong performances. Morwick who plays the role of Peter (also screenwriter and director) does a wonderful job of portraying a vulnerable character with a little boy quality that the audience comes to care about. Peter's best friends Teddy and Sean are played by Brandon Johnson and Marcus Bonee who are unfortunately not so lucky and the audience waits in dread.<br /><br />This movie is cleverly balanced with moments of terror and carefully chosen moments of comic relief. The movie is special because it is taking this genre and doing something fresh with it. Through stylized photography and artwork and a score that is close to a hauntingly sweet jack-in-the-box, watch out! Beyond the beautiful exterior of it all, evil lurks. This may very well become a classic. - Reviewed by Sandra Wint, Tribeca- NYC

"<br /><br />This movie is nothing but a David Whateverhisnameis vanity project (written/acted/directed by...), and it shows in every interminable scene of this over-long and dull STV miscarriage. The film has the air and atmosphere of a swaddled cot-death baby and I fear that is due more to neglect than over-nurturing.<br /><br />The opening scene is kind of promising, and sets a vaguely supernatural feeling air, but drops such allusions immediately thereafter and turns into a plodding pedestrian made-for-TV pseudo-thriller.<br /><br />There is no suspense, no gore, no shocks, no horror, no surprises and nothing remotely inspiring to be seen. The film just drags and drags on and it feels much longer than it's 84min run-time.<br /><br />The main "trick" of the movie will soon make you so sick of it you will wish never ever to see any "the killer" pass quickly across in front of camera ever again. Yes. That "trick". Already bored of it, well too bad, because it's done to death in Little Erin Merryweather. There she goes flashing across in the background...oh, there she goes flashing past in the foreground...yeah.<br /><br />The script is a try-hard affair, but unfortunately the writer should have tried a lot harder, as it comes across very clumsily in delivery. The acting is jarring at best, and jaw-droppingly appalling in some scenes, lending an even greater air of implausibility to an already shaky script.<br /><br />****SPOILERS FOLLOW******<br /><br />Add into the mix such criminal plot-holes as her mysteriously being able to vanish at the end, while the person who shot her must clearly be looking directly at her, and I'm sorry but the movie becomes even more of a shambolic hack-job.<br /><br />Worst movie I've seen in a long long time, so don't be drawn in by the nice box art like I was.

Oh my god, how bizarre was this movie! We saw this at one of the screenings in New York and I'll never forget it, because I hate horror movies and my boyfriend knows this. Later that night he terrorized me jumping out at me in the house with a red blanket over his head threatening to put rocks in my stomach. Needless to say, he's a freak and this movie was right up his alley.<br /><br />This movie really creeped me out. I loved that the "men" were the stupid vicitms for once. Speaking of that, there were some very cute boys in this movie. And then there's the doll. I hate dolls to begin with. This one is the mother of them all- it has no eyes.<br /><br />Seriously though, this is a great film... great music, actors, scenery yadda yadda... It definitely builds because when it gets to the point where there's only the one boy left, and he's hiding from her in the library, I was literally hiding under my seat. Even if you're not a horror freak like my boyfriend, you should still check it out because it is different and very creative.

I've seen plenty of nanny from hell flicks but this movie is sort of the librarian from hell. I couldn't figure out if I wanted to sleep with her or take a bat and bludgeon her to death. The actress that played Erin really got under my skin. Although I would have liked to seen her naked or someone in the film take their clothes off, but it is what it is. The scene where she really freaks me out is where she's looking out a window or something, looking all insane and spaced out. The dude who played the cop was a bit over the top but the rest of the lead actors were actually pretty damn good. The other thing that I thought was freaky was the little kid's nursery rhymes and as the movie goes on, you realize that these have double meanings for all the murders which is pretty cool. I also liked how they filmed everything with the color red. Low budget and flawed but really dig the style.

I'm usually very wary of horror films that centre around a fairy tale basis but this was a brilliant movie. The cast was brilliant (bar from the cop.) The actress who plays Erin has a very Fatal Attraction Glenn Close charm about her and has the ability to go from sweet and innocent to dark and menacing in an instant. The script was remarkably well written. It was very chilling movie and kept you on the edge of your seat. The artistic direction especially the illustrations used to tell the story are breathtaking. I am really hoping that there will be a sequel to this. It also deserves more recognition than. Hats off to everyone who worked on this movie.

A quirky paean to horror films of decades past, Little Erin Merryweather has a panache all its own, with an eerie yet elegant storyline punctuated by scares and shocks reminiscent of the classic thriller Halloween  and a back story that re-boots, of all things, Little Red Riding Hood.<br /><br />But this modern-day fairy tale turns very grim and may not have a happy ending. Somewhere, lurking amidst the snowy woods of a small college town, a killer in red dispatches victims with three startling similarities: They're male, they're blond, and they have (take note) dirty hands. It's not a spoiler to say the killer is female and her motivation stems from a horrific childhood. Now she wants revenge. So beware her creepy doll of cracked porcelain, complete with a ghoulish pair of hollowed-out eyes. And just know: If there's a flash of red  trouble's ahead.<br /><br />After the first murder, college student Peter Bloom (David Morwick) suspects a serial killer on the loose. His buddies on the school paper razz him. After all, they point out, Peter also believes in Bigfoot and claimed one of his professors was a werewolf. Still, like any good reporter, Peter snoops, until uncovering the scoop that may win him a byline but cost him his life.<br /><br />Morwick  who also directed the film and wrote its screenplay  is charming and determined, brave enough to take on the killer in a spooky school library, yet vulnerable enough to shyly squirm and stammer during a coffee date. Vigdis Anholt somehow brings a sweet, sympathetic frailty to her role as a serial killer. True, she's a loon, but not a mindless one, and when she flirts with Morwick and looks into his handsome face, you just know there's a part of her that wants to date this guy, not decapitate him. Then she looks at his fingers  too bad, the poor boy apparently has newsprint or something on them - and her rage kicks in.<br /><br />Unlike nearly all of today's horror films  including virtually every minute of the Saw franchise  Merryweather's scares don't soak you in blood. For sure, the shocks are there; be prepared to jump half-a-dozen times during the climax. But as Hitchcock proved in Psycho, and Carpenter mastered in Halloween, Morwick's use of sound, like the slash of a knife slicing a body, are actually far more terrifying than displaying bloody leftovers.<br /><br />Grossing out moviegoers is easy. Jolting them is hard. Giving them a reason to care about characters in trouble  even harder. Little Erin Merryweather takes that hardest of roads and succeeds. Much more than gore, its haunted resonance offers a lingering chill. Put it this way: If Jaws kept swimmers out of the water, then Little Erin Merryweather surely will keep your fingernails clean.

I had the pleasure of seeing this film at a festival, and frankly I cannot wait for the movie to be released in theaters. Little Erin Merryweather is about 3 boys who are 'literally' trying to survive college as a homicidal killer, Erin Merryweather (played by Vigdes Anholt), stalks her prey on campus and maniacally seeks to destroy them. The ring-leader of this hunted trio is the wise-cracking sarcastic Teddy (played by Brandon Johnson of 'One Life To Live'). Added to him is everyone's all-purpose buddy and ever too trusting Sean (played by Marcus Bonee). Rounding out the trio is the most all-American of the boys...blonde-haired Peter (played by former Talbot's model David Morwick... a dead ringer for Christopher Atkins of 'Blue Lagoon' fame). I would not call this film terrifying as much as I would say that it is tension-filled. It leaves you on the edge of your seat waiting for these three innocents to fall prey to a killer without a conscience. Whoever did the casting for this film certainly has an eye for talent, spotting upcoming star power. Watch especially for Johnson and Morwick, as well as Vigdes Anholt. I am guessing that the latter is foreign with a name like that, LOL.

When I finished watching this film, I felt sucker-punched. I was hoping for some laughs from another grade D horror film. I guess the joke's on me. Little Erin Merryweather was good, not perfect but good. David Morwick is kind of the man behind the curtain as director, actor, writer. (most indies require people to wear a lot of hats which he did well) But I think it's safe to say his strength is in the acting department.<br /><br />Morwick is very funny and likable in the lead role of Peter and probably brings in the strongest performance. We all know that bumbling, fidgety kid we went to school with and Morwick plays that part perfectly, to a tee. Although Vigdis Anholt (Erin) doesn't say much, her performance can be summed up by the old adage, "if looks could kill. . ." Her body language and chilling stares is what spooked me the most. I give the filmmakers two thumbs up for turning the genre on its head in a sense and letting a female villain take a whack at this. Where the film falls short is in the pacing. It's just a little slow at times, probably due to budget issues. But, this has made up for an overall style, mood and atmosphere of the film. Before you poo-poo this as just another low budget slasher, take another look. Speaking of the look of the film, it really captured those rich, depth of field shots.<br /><br />What struck me the most with Little Erin Merryweather and I have seen other people comment on this is that they really achieved the throwback to the "70's". This film looks like it was made in 1976, 1977, right down to the actors. I would never have guessed this was made today. There's no morphed reflection of today's society at all. I don't know how they achieved this, but they did.

I saw this film in some kind of strange language that wasn't English. The subtitles were on, but they appeared to be in the same strange language. The subtitles were also very confusing. They had upside down question marks and exclamation points. And if they're going to make a film be in a different languages, they should at least use CGI to make the mouth movements match up with the actual language.<br /><br />I would give this one star, but it gains one more because the girls had HOTT breasts. Like honestly, if you could only see them without any clothes on bouncing around their God-given glory, this film would get at least a nine, despite whatever confusing, made up language it was in.<br /><br />In summary, "iAy Papi!"? What the hell is that? But the boobs were nice. Therefore, on my ratings scale of red to blue, red being Shallow Hal and blue being The Sum of All Fears, this film gets a gets Puce Minus.

This movie is practically my all time favorite. At least favorite comedy. It is absolutely brilliant, with lovely actors hilarious script, everything really.<br /><br />Jez (Stuart Townsend) is very cute and just incredible. Georgie (Kate Beckinsale) is almost like I would have wanted to be if I could choose.<br /><br />I love this movie so much, and I laughed just as much when I'd seen it three times as after the first.

I really didn't expect much from it. I rented it because I didn't know what other 'new' release comedies I could watch and enjoy. I'm glad I did. It was really quite entertaining. If you have the time, watch the cast commentary as well. hilarious lol. I def. thought Sofia Vergara's comedic timing was awesome too. she had me laughing every time.<br /><br />another surprise was that the movie was only PG! not even PG-13. awesome. I'm glad there wasn't much over-the-top sensuality. the movie really didn't need it at all. bravo!<br /><br />It's a great movie to pop in when you just want to relax and laugh. uptight arses, do not watch this movie. it's not supposed to be another one of those lame dramatic blockbuster mysteries.

This was 20th Century Fox's first attempt to make a movie targeting the Latino community. From this regard it is an important first step by Hollywood in acknowledging a growing trend in America. To be sure, the strength of the Latin community will dictate that studios figure out the right formula versus Latinos succumbing to what studios think they should watch. So in this regard, I give it 10 stars.<br /><br />Some other impressive elements come from the casting. Jaci Velasquez is a Christian artist and notice that her theatrical debut is a PG movie and how she wore the one-piece bathing suit and otherwise maintained a modest demeanor alongside her co-stars. Another reason to consider Ms. Velasquez a role model for teens and to applaud Fox for not offering up an over-sexed first attempt to draw in Latino crowds.<br /><br />Unfortunately the plot is somewhat vapid which is why I don't necessarily recommend the movie other than for its pivotal place in a movement that is gaining momentum.

This movie was stupid and boring. I noticed that whenever Sofia VERGARA comes out in a movie, it is usually not a big hit. She really needs to enroll in some acting lessons. I think she needs to improve her English because her accent makes it very difficult to understand what the heck she is saying. I think she should stick to making calendars; the only thing she knows to do best. I remember when this movie first came out, it only lasted two weeks and it was directly sent to the dollar movies like a bullet. That is so embarrassing. The main problem is that now a days, people choose an actor according to their physical beauty. Many do not keep in mind that beauty and acting skills are two totally different things that should not be confused when choosing a great actor.

This movie is beyond bad, I thought it could be a decent enough comedy with some hot latina-chicks.<br /><br />The latter there were plenty of, but the style of this movie is extremely childish so there aren't any sexiness going on, I mean just look at the rating: Rated PG for MILD sensuality.<br /><br />The story is as if taken from a Spanish-SOAP-OPERA and the acting is as over-the-top as that as well, I found SOFIA VERGARA funny in SOUL PLANE and ROSELYN SANCHEZ is good in WITHOUT A TRACE but they were as bad as the rest of the bunch in this "comedy".<br /><br />Comedy: Yes, but where are the jokes? Were there any? And did this movie even make me chuckle even once? No.<br /><br />Not even cameo's from talents DL HUGHLEY (Stand-Up-Comedian) and FREDDY RODRIGUEZ (Harsh Times) could make me enjoy this movie, it just made me think how on earth they got into this horrible movie.<br /><br />One thing that's even more confusing is the fact that FOREST WHITAKER is listed as a producer, to me he's one of Hollywood's finest and hopefully his producer-spot just meant that he financed the movie and wasn't actually a part of making this movie because that would have been a shame.<br /><br />I'm bagging on a lot of people here, but the biggest bag should be on the lead guy Thomas (played by Eduardo Verástegui) whom delivers some of the worst acting I have ever seen in recent years, he is beyond bad in a way I can't even describe.<br /><br />There's one good thing about it though, without the start and end-credits the movie is only about 70 minutes long.<br /><br />If you want a romantic-comedy with latino-actors there is always SUENO (John Leguizamo, Elisabeth Pena) which I quite like.

My wife and I saw this film yesterday and I thought that it was a pretty good movie. Of course, my motivation to see it was to get a look at Roselyn Sanchez and Sofia Vergara. I figured that my wife could have equal eye candy with the main actor who played Popi. It is interesting to note that this movie was directed by a Latina, and of course featured a great many latinos in the movie, with very few other ethnic actors. While I am caucasian, it didn't really bother me that there was only a couple of Anglo people in it, and only one African American I believe. But, as it was directed by a Latin woman, I was surprised at how much the movie seemed to be geared towards the Anglo-movie watching crowd. I don't have any problem with that and I feel that the director was really centered on empowering women, which is great. I just wonder if Latinos who watch this might feel themselves betrayed a bit by the Hollywood feel of this film. I don't think that it is a vehicle for too much serious lessons or life examples, and feel that it is more along the lines of just plain popcorn fun. Which in today's crummy world, is just fine to enjoy for a couple hours out of your day. I thought that it was a fun movie and I can spend all day looking at women like Roselyn Sanchez and Sofia Vergara. Who wouldn't drink dirty bath water from the likes of those two women? I know that I would be in line for a chance!! What absolute dream women!! HOT-CHA-CHA!!

Obviously this movie would have been terrible without the attractive women, but it was still very entertaining. I'm surprised at people that gave this movie a score of 1, I don't know what people expected of this movie but it was exactly what I expected, and cute comedy with a somewhat very thin plot with some fun times. Nothing more.

Okay so I saw this movie last week and from reading reviews and what not I was expecting it too be painful to watch. Not at all! I thought it was funny and I saw no negative stereotypes whatsoever I've read something saying the plot was all over the place...umm no. If you pay attention you'll get it. I have A.D.D. and it wasn't challenging for me.I'm a fan of Sofia Vergara and I thought she was hilarious. Roselyn Sanchez and Jaci Velasquez were also great and they really worked well together and with Eduardo. I must admit though I also watched it with commentary on and its even, their super funny and you can tell they really enjoyed each other. Its entertaining!

Okay I realized this movie was not made for me... I am not a woman nor a latino but for creators sake at least the writers could have done was create 3-dimensional characters.<br /><br />All the dialog was overshadowed by Spanish music. Seems like they were trying to sell the latest in Latin music than sell the characters. But on the other hand I could see the reason why...<br /><br />The acting was Gawd horrible...I watched this movie high on caffeine but for some reason found it extremely difficult to stay awake.<br /><br />I didn't even know this movie actually went to the theaters. It should have been left on the cutting room floor... all 8,100 feet! My belief was that some studio exec got a hard-on seeing the leading latinas in the same movie and decided to cough up some dough.<br /><br />I used this film as production research to see what the production did with 5 million dollars and its obvious it was totally wasted! Do yourself a favor rent this movie and keep the DVD... It makes for a nice drink coaster.

Despite the best intentions and effort of all involved this just doesn't work.<br /><br />It has energy and tries hard but farce is a difficult trick to pull off - it requires real comic timing and really good situations.<br /><br />Unlike French farce this Hispanic farce relies on a single device: man dates three women all discover this then fall over each other to first get him for themselves, then a subplot involving criminals, then strong women emerge.<br /><br />My problems is this: a group of women watching this with pizza on a Friday night will enjoy the first 30 minutes and the last 15 but the bit in between just ain't entertainment. <br /><br />It's not the fault of script / director / actors: it just hasn't got enough steam to shine in any way.<br /><br />Love to see more films aimed at the Hispanic community: but comedy needs working on to make a great cross-over movie. <br /><br />Something dumb like LA rich kid goes to Puerto Rico might work, but sophisticated romantic comedy would be better.... best of all, why not try watching Almavador and see what happens? Please!

Chasing Papi is an excellent example of the mingling of the Latino-American and Anglo-American culture!<br /><br />Linda Mendoza's debut movie proved to be a great success, a well made movie, hot, spicy, funny, and the 4 stars of this movie are the most beautiful people on the planet! Gorgeous, award winning Eduardo Verástegui, the emerald green eyed hero of México, known all over the world as the beautiful gipsy hero in the jennifer Lopez clip ""Ain't it Funny"" (#1 on the charts in almost 100 countries) is the fastest rising male Latino star! Eduardo is a great example for all of us, his sincerity, warmth and kindness are magnificent. Eduardo is very active helping to fund charity projects, a man always ready to help people in need. Thinking of all these wonderful aspects of Eduardo makes seeing him in action all the more wonderful!<br /><br />And then, back to the storyline of the movie! Méxican superstar Eduardo plays with great fun and dedication Tomas, an executive in love with 3 woman! These 3 woman are not just woman, they are the most beautiful ladies of America Latín!!<br /><br />The 3 female superstars are not only of dazzling beauty, they act superb as well, as in the movie they are all in love with Tomas without knowing this from each other. Everything explodes into a funny romantic, twisting and turning storyline when the 3 woman decide to teach their Chasing Papi a lesson..<br /><br />The movie glows of enthusiasm, dedication, made by a great crew, and incredible cast, warm wonderful people. You can see the best of Hollywood here, a truelly 21th Century Hollywood, where no longer cold egocentrism and Big Money Rules, but these facts shown to be replaced by warmth, and kindness.<br /><br />This new, better face of Hollywood we can be proud of, we hope this is the new trend, and more movies of such nice wonderful people will appear! The friendship among the entire Chasing Papi-crew, the great work of Fox 2000, proves there is a bright future for the new generation superstars!<br /><br />My deepest appreciation for all the people that made Chasing Papi such a very special and dear project!<br /><br />For all of you who missed the movie, there is the DVD/video available at Amazon.com. Type ""Chasing Papi"" in the search box and order. Watch and enjoy!<br /><br />Anthonie van Vliet M.Sc.

Shooting Fish was something I got out on a risk, you know.....no other film in video store, take a chance.<br /><br />It proved to be a wise decision as the film was very funny, two great opposites for the main male characters and the stunning kate beckinsale acted the part wonderfully.<br /><br />The film has no slow points, but does not rush things, the accompanying music is very good and acting first class.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone

I admit that when I first heard of this movie starring Sofi'a , I wanted to see Sofi'a topless or in lace nightgowns..but that changed when I watched this movie.. I was familiar with Roselyn's work (Boat Trip,Rush Hour 2)and this was the 1st time I saw Jaci. Like with most of the fans of this movie,I fairly enjoyed it,as a guy -I enjoyed the eye-candy..Especially Sofi'a,even though she emulated that "cuchi-cuchi" Charo style,with her comical antics and Sofi'a over doing her hot and sexy colombian accent!! Because this movie was directed by a woman,this was a light screwball comedy..the story was simple,the comedy tame,lot of silly cliché's(especially for Sofi'a)and the acting was OK,though I was surprised at Sofi'a's comedy timing,since she never had any training at acting!!I don't know if this movie would have been better if a man directed this,his perspective.But because I enjoyed watching Sofi'a working off on the other Latina's,in all their sexiest,I could bare to watch this over again!!!

this is the most pathetic movie i've ever seen. it don't come close to being funny. i can't understand y this movie was even made in the first place. it wasn't romantic or even slightly sexy, as i expected it to be. and there no story. really a waste of time. avoid at all cost.

There is a vaccum in space because of this movie. This takes pathetic to a whole new level. The acting is lame, the story line is incipid, the plot, oh yeah, what plot? The insult to Latin women - come on, the old "keep 'em barefoot and pregnant" is the only line missing. Don't bother not even from Blockbuster.

I wanted to like this film. Yet, even with the significant eye candy, I couldn't find anything else enjoyable about this film. It wasn't funny. It didn't have any sexuality and nothing in the film was executed properly. <br /><br />For a film that features women on the run, the director of this film did not put any strain on these actresses. The lead actresses were not instructed to do anything strenuous. I was suppose to believe that they did all this running around, with their stilettos still intact. <br /><br />The supporting cast was weak. Only Paul Rodriquez did his role justice. I was surprised how well Sofia Vergara did in this movie. In the preshowings I saw, she looked like the weakest of the women casted. However, it turns out she was the strongest of the women and provided a solid performance. I thought that Roselyn Sanchez would be the main focus of the film. But, she consistently ruined her lines and she didn't seem comfortable at all speaking the dialogue. Jaci Velasquez did a fair job, being this was her first film. I can't see why the "Christian Freaks" were so hard on her for taking this film. I mean, she kept her clothes on. She didn't swear. She wasn't even playing a negative role. She was playing a character. Get over it, Y'all. Overall though, I thought the three women together were mediocre. Then, to top off this unsatisfactory film. They have this whack ending about female independence. Whattttt!!!??? Most of the movie was about female dependence and they try to sell it as a tale of liberation? Please!!! <br /><br />Like I said before, I wish I could say I liked it, but I can't. It was very disappointing. I hope the next time they bring three lovely latinas together on screen, they will support them with a decent plot, well rounded characters and make them perform their tails off. As well, as suppling great eye candy. Unfortunately, Chasing Papi isn't that movie. <br /><br />2 out of 10.

I can't sit still to watch many movies. Yet, this one I could. Reason number one, three hot latina women. I love latina women. Reason number two.. ehh none. It is pretty entertaining. Each of the three women have very distinct personalities. One values beauty, the other education, and the other culture. Also each one is from a different city. The man, Tomas is dating three different women. Somehow all three women end up at his house, when he trys to explain his situation, he falls out under a tranquilizer pill he took before. Then the women see a 4th woman looking in the house, and think she is a 4th woman. She is really an FBI agent. The movie's good points are some animated cut scenes which you cant tell if they are geared for kids or adults, some Spanish words. I enjoyed that given I am almost fluent in Spanish. The end gets somewhat cartoonish... I won't spoil it. But if you like Spanish culture, or pretty latina women, you should not be bored with it, also it is kid friendly.

Nonsingle with beautiful women a film can be done, Chasing Papi is an example. The most rotten and vulgar topics meet in this discouraging history in which it recreates most shameful of those Latin ridiculous to hills of the typical tics that presumably represent them: the machismo, the hot crotch, the rate and little more. And all decorated it, in addition and to top it all, with a strange and distant language in a depressing attempt to even degrade plus the Spanish as tribute to the master who pays. One feels defenseless before so large aggression and single they are left desire to vomit later to see resemblance clown outfit. That yes, saving the beautiful physicist of those three splendids feminines protagonists. Something is something.

I had to see this movie due to my job. Wish I hadn't, because the last time I had such fun time like this one, it's when I went through two endoscopias in a row (it's when a doctor puts in you a camera by the throat to check your stomach from the inside). This movie is like any sketch extracted from Lente loco or any other TV show made by latin people in the spanish spoken networks in the USA -if you've ever had the misfortune of tuning in any, then you'll know what I mean-, but, an hour and plus long. And if you can't make those gags work in a five minutes range, then guess what happens when you stretch them way beyond their boundaries.<br /><br />That is exactly the aesthetics in Chasing Papi; this total piece of crap features latin "stars" that are everything but actors, and anything but funny. It´s just a bad cast of cute people speaking in english -or trying to- just because they are supposed to live in Miami, Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. I don't know why they talk to each other in a foreign language when ALL of them speak spanish. I was embarrassed by hearing this ridiculous attempt of communicate in english; really. And this is primarily what gets me confused: is it for the latin community living in the US? I don´t think so, since almost every person of it speaks none other language but spanish (and I know it, because I've lived in California). Is it for the people from the United States? I guess not either, mainly because the actors (?) may be barely known between them. Besides watching voluptuous women wearing almost nothing -and that's a more than reasonable excuse for a lot of guys to watch anything; but don't count me in-, this is a TOTAL waste of time. I'd rather follow an ant´s trail straight to their home instead of watching this crap again or any similar attempt to kill the most insignificant sense of film appreciation in a moviegoer.<br /><br />I know that anybody shouldn't expect a two thumbs up experience due to the people involved, but it's just that I felt real bad for my time being stolen this way that I felt the urge to write this as a kind of warning, so, don't go see it nor even get close to it unless you're a fan of the kind of trash made in the TV show mentioned above, or any other garbage from networks like Telemundo or Univision.

the only redeeming thing about this movie is the background music. Not even Carlos Ponce could save this movie! It is a horrible vehicle for a couple of Latin music's up and coming, or more accurately, wanna be's, and I would strongly recommend you buy a copy of Playboy/playgirl if all you want is eye candy. This is an insult to women, particularly Latin women and the stereo types in this movie set women and Latinos back at least 20 years. Oh, Cisco, Oh Pancho! Not much better than that. Save your money - I'm grateful I got to see if for free or I would have asked for my money back. I wouldn't even rent this for my worst enemy - and if offered a free copy, I would refuse.

Ah yes, finally the long awaited `Chasing Papi' as finally came out.<br /><br />The film stars Rosalyn Sanchez, Sofia Vergara and Jaci Velasquez as three feisty Latinas..one is a Cocktail waitress, Ceci, (Sofia Vergara), a lawyer for the people, Lorena,(Rosalyn Sanchez) and a rich spoiled brat who is naïve to the world, Patricia (Jaci Velasquez). They are all in love and want to marry the same man Tomas (Eduardo Verastegui), who is stressing out cause of the many relationship...<br /><br />When the three women want to surprise their love with a surprise visit all hell breaks loose. Tomas starts to really stress and he takes too man tranks and falls asleep for a really long time.and the girls are trying to figure out what to do..<br /><br />I found the movie to be very funny and the actresses were very beautiful. The movie is predicable and the dialog is a little lame, but it is entertaining and there are a few surprises.I smiled and found myself really enjoying it.<br /><br />I am glad that this film was made. It is cool to see a Romantic Comedy have an all Latin cast and it was good to see Latinas being successful in life, rather then just being a maid or some illegal.<br /><br />I recommend it! I will post some pics from the film!<br /><br />Rated PG for suggestive humor!

The movie was obviously attempting to be like one of the classic screwball romantic comedies. It succeeds in the style, but not exactly the comedy. Don't get me wrong, there are laughs, but it could've been a lot funnier. I blame part of the failed comic attempts on the writing and part on the actors. They should've just filmed the movie in Spanish. Some of the Hispanic actors really seemed to struggle with the English dialogue. In comedy, it's all about timing, so the expression of the dialogue must be on target. I give the actors points for effort, but all that hard work could've been spared if they spoke in their native language. <br /><br />I think what mainly makes the film work for me is the fast pace. Despite how silly each situation is, the pace is fast enough to prevent you from dwelling on the silliness. Plus, seeing three beautiful Latina women strut their stuff throughout doesn't hurt either. I saw Sofia Vergara before in "Big Trouble," but she looks different in the movie and I might not have remembered from that previous film because well...I'm trying not to remember it period. It was one of the worst comedies I've ever seen! "Chasing Papi" gives her a much better outlet for her talent. She has got to be THE most beautiful women I've ever seen! Whenever I see her on screen, I feel like Jim Carrey in "The Mask" when he was watching Cameron Diaz do that musical number. If my jaw could literally drop like his character, that would be my exact reaction. I mean, she makes Roselyn Sanchez pale in comparison, and saying a hell of a lot. <br /><br />All I can say is the film is a lot of fun. I'm surprised by the extremely low rating. And by the way, Paul Rodriguez has a funny cameo, playing similar to the Michael Caine role in "Miss Congeniality." <br /><br />My score: 7 (out of 10)

This movie is simply great. While it perhaps lacks a larger social message, other than the simple "do good with what you have", it is a smart, funny movie which definitely has its moments, both cinematic and dramatic. The rags to riches story of two orphan con men: one, a genius Brit, the other, the American spin doctor. Together they engage in "shooting fish", or fleecing rich people of their extra cash, in order to buy themselves the lavish house they've each coveted because of their simple upbringing. The story is fun and engaging, the characters seem very very real, and the different cons they pull off together are extremely funny. I won't give away any of the story, except to say that the has a nice, unexpected twist. An excellent date movie, or even to take in with a couple of close friends. You may not laugh out loud the whole time like you did at "There's Something About Mary" or other slapstick comedies, but you'll definitely be smiling the whole time, and by the time the credits role you'll simply be in a much better mood than you were when you started.

I've read some the reviews that people made in regards to this movie and all I can say is take it easy - this movie DOES NOT deplict the average latino but it does reflect a funny view to the Casanova that is actually a nice guy who actually falls for 3 different ladies.<br /><br /> If this movie was made with pure white/anglo/european actors and it was called Chasing Stud - I'm sure the anglo community wouldn't be so agitated by the flick.<br /><br /> In the DVD the director mentioned that that she wanted to capture the goofy and fun-loving interaction from the movies in the 60's like What's Up Doc with Barbara Stresan and she succeeded with this movie.<br /><br /> As a latino - I do not find this movie at all offensive to my latin culture (Puerto Rican/Colombian) and everyone (family/friends)I talked to about this movie found it to be cute and funny.<br /><br /> So, sit back, watch, crack up and enjoy the movie!!!!1

Well , After i watch this movie i have many things to say about it , 1st of all the drama line is so flat , some of the characters if we remove it from the script they will not affect the drama like Ahmed Rateb , Tamer Abdul Moneam (son of Nour Al Sheriff ), and Yosra (her role is sooo boring), also the homosexuality takes too much from the duration of the film , it's not my business to see the gay sleeping on his face more than one time , they could make his role shorter , and also there's no connection or relations between the people who living in the building , they could even meet each other even one time to believe that they live at the same building , what will happen if Nour Al Sheriff Meet Adel Emam once ? it's not hard , and also why they focused on the sex relationship between the Islamic boy (Mohamed Imam ) and his wife at the training place , we saw them sleeping naked two times , why ?? is it a problem when a man sleeping with his wife ? what did they want to improve ? the main thing that i want to talk about it : this the first Egyptian film that scanned to make the color grading and the visual effects on non linear systems ( like Hollywood movies ) , but we didn't see any color grading or great quality like we imagined ? so why the cost themselves if they want the picture like that ?? i really don't know !! i know that many people will have the negative point of view from mine , and all the people here in Egypt saying : Wow what a great movie , what a huge budget , what a great cast that met for the first time ... but that's not the green card for the success of any film , we all watched a movie called ( Heat ) by Al Pacino & Robert De Niro and both of them are great great actors , but the movie was not as great as their names...anyway that's only my point of view ...thanks

This is the first Egyptian movie that has a very high propaganda by all advertising means as well as the first Egyptian movie that has been awarded in Tribeca Film Festival & participated in Berlinale & Cannes 2006 & still may be have a chance in the 2007 Oscars in the best foreign Film Category .<br /><br />The movie shows some examples of people who have lived in the huge historical building known as (Jaocbian Building) in the city center & how the political status & changes in Egypt had influenced every person who has lived in this house.<br /><br />The main two characters were Zaki El Desouky (Adel Imam)& Haj Azzam (Nour El Sheriff). The first (Zaki) was previously known as a (Basha) a very well rich man before the Egyptian revolution & now he is a normal old citizen who has his teenage fantasies with many sexual relations with hookers & no job to do except avoiding his evil sister played by (Esad Younes) who kicked him out of his house & tries to send him to a psychyatric hospital at the end to vanquish him forever.<br /><br />The second character (Azzam) was a shoe polisher in the old days & turned to be a very rich man who has Car agencies & huge stores in Egypt & is searching for another wife to marry for fulfilling his sexual interest but with marriage he thinks that he is on the right track according to religion but when the story goes on it shows us how cruel he was with his new beautiful wife (Somaya El Khashab) & on the other hand he entered the Egyptian assembly with his relations with some government officials.<br /><br />The third character was played by (Khaled El Sawwy) & in my opinion he was the best in role reflecting the character of the news reporter (Hazem Farid) who is very keen on his work but at night his sexual fantasies appear as being GAY & searching for poor men to sleep with him at night. He is totally ready to pay them anything & give them all his money... maybe all his life to have a nice time in bed with a man . This is a very disgusting idea but the actor excelled in acting this role specifically which made him on top of the main actors making you believe that he was a real gay .<br /><br />The fourth character was for a teenager named Taha played by (Mohamed Imam)a son of the doorman who got engaged to a poor girl (Hend Sabry)who lives on the roof & he tried to enter the police academy but was refused for being a son of the door man .Entering another faculty & meeting some weird religious people made him change his view in life & leave his beard then participates in a demonostration where he is arrested & then being raped & tortured to death behind bars turns his decent character to a terrorist trying to get revenge from the police officer who caused him all his pains & the ending is a real sorrow .<br /><br />The fifth & maybe final main character was for the poor girl (Hend Sabry) who was working in a shop with a disgusting owner who tried to fulfill his fantasies with the young girl in the stock . Then she leaves the rotten job to work for Zaki el Desouky & their relation changes to be friends & ends by marriage .<br /><br />The whole film is a new trend which reflects the history of Egypt in 75 years but at the same time it is not a summer commercial movie like the audience expect . it is a movie for cinematic festivals & it will be highly appreciated to the people who concentrate in its symbols & metaphors .<br /><br />A word to finish with is that there were some goofs i this movie because the events occur in 1995 & the director mistakenly showed some wrong signs that weren't there at this time. 1- There is a small street advertisement for Vodafone in front of Cairo university & in 1995 there were no cellular phones ! 2- The streets of Cairo show the new transport green buses & minibuses which didn't exist before 2004 . 3- The streets also show the prepaid card telephones in street known as (Menatel) which didn't exist either . 4- Finally inside the Groppi Cafe there was a Pepsi refrigerator holding the new Logo of Pepsi which was designed in 1999 while in 1995 there was another Logo !

A triumph You have to do the Hat trick For the three Actors Adel Imam The one and only who remain on the top for years And the outstanding performance by the superb actor Khaled El Sawy You can add also Ahmad Bedeir for his excellent role But Writer-producer Waheed Hamed (who also is the director's father) treats the novel with too much reverence. His script indulges in much minutia and repetitive action. But the acting is strong, and his son's control of story, characters and visual imagery makes this an engrossing, highly watchable old-fashioned melodrama. For the Egyptian movie industry which produces a retarded movies for retarded audience such as Bo7a I'll give this one 10 out of 10

I saw this one yesterday at the Stockholm Filmfestival.<br /><br />Nice try, but I didn't connect to any of the characters in this movie. They tried to make stories of different life-situations all connected to the same building. Some of these stories might have been interesting if done differently but they were actually just kind of boring. They tried to make some of the characters sympathetical but they weren't perceived as such, at least not by me. Some points in the movie were over exaggerated and some were not explained at all. one of the few movies I've seen that I actually didn't care at all how it ended. and that's not a very good sign... no, nice try but this one is a stinker.<br /><br />/B

Aside from the technical issues of directing, the movie was a total failure, those who did not read the novel have seen nothing! Waheed hamed's lame adaptation ruined the whole spirit of the book, the lines are more of a "Nadia el gendy" or "nabeela edeid" film.<br /><br />The whole scene is supposed to be set in the early 90s, yet nothing in the customs or the events can be of the 90s.<br /><br />Special lines and scenes are added for Zaky el dessouki (Adel emam) only because he's a famous comedian and the audience would like him to throw a joke every now and then although it's totally unnecessary,Taha's (Mohamed emam) clothes are not of his social class in anyway!<br /><br />The amazing spirit of neutrality that one can find in the novel has been brutally destroyed in the movie where you can take sides easily.<br /><br />The soundtrack is nonsense, people in theatres were laughing most of the time specially in the Gay love scenes as the proper music for the moment is lost.<br /><br />All I can think of is that those Old guys desperately tryed to seize the moment and have their share of the new Egyptian film industry cake that the young actors built over the past 8 years or so!<br /><br />Guess i'm obviously biased , but that's how I see it.

It's a great movie that shows the changes that happened in the Egyptian Society from the age of the kingdom of Egypt until our age now. He shows this by a building called The Yacoubian Building in which each character in it signifies a character in the Egyptian society. I've one comment on the movie, I don't know why the author included a sex issue in each character as if sex is a main axis in our life. Also the character of Hatem and Abd Rabo I think it's a very rare case in an Islamic society although the actors role was very complicated and hard but they made it with Professionalism. the movie is really so good and the director succeeded in making the movie although its his first movie. enjoy it.

The movie was great as it represent many true images from Egyptian actual life, and when I was watching the movies I felt many f the movie characters are sitting beside me. I liked the homosexual part as it was really good played by Kaled Elsawy and it's really the 1st time in Egyptian movies to show a true human analyses for this strange character, also the dialogue contained many expressive words. I liked the focus on poor student who has been hurt from Egyptian government security agent. I didn't like Yousra in this movie and I hate her voice when she was singing in French and I felt her too boring this time. Adel Imam and Nour Elsherif are not truly connected in the movie and I think it's a director mistake. Ahmed Beder has a short important character and I think he supported the movie to not be walking in confusion drama. Finally I liked the movie and I feel it's great to be seen. Traooka

This movie has definitely changed the map of the Egyptian movie making industry.Meaning, future makings should at least level up to half of what Marwan Hamed the promising director has produced. I will not repeat words like "Masterpiece" or " an Oscar winning Movie", but I fear that Marwan has produced a piece of work that should make him produce more of the same level. And that is the real challenge.<br /><br />I also feel that this daring story has opened the way or paved it for more creativity without the need to worry about censorship or limiting expressions. I am so happy to have seen so many taboos on the screen in order for the people to discuss and find solutions. Therefore, to share the problems of the Egyptians with the public through movies is also another challenge that the movie industry has to work on. <br /><br />I hope we see other competing directors who will force the audience to be totally engrossed in whatever they are watching.<br /><br />Eman Al Masri

I have read the book a year & a half ago, was fascinated by it, but as it goes had some very high expectation about the movie.<br /><br />The cast off course was logical although some names that were nominated to take part declined, at my great astonishment the movie was simply awesome.<br /><br />All characters were obviously very well written as a script , the actors ,all of them gave an outstanding performance, Adel Imam , radiant , witty & funny as ever;Nour el Sheriff made a come back..... it's been a while since I've seen him perform so well on the silver screen; Hend Sabry was lovely; Yousra just Radiant; Esaad Younes more than superb; Ahmed Bedier Wow.... he had the Egyptian Coptic genera nailed to the T; Ahmed Rateb as usual a gr8 performance although the part was too small for such a talent;Khaled Saleh a monster of acting A+ ; Soumaya el khashab a small role but with a lot of soul put into it.<br /><br />The bomb or should I say bombs are Mohamed Imam a very impressive performance for a 1st timer, I was amazed by the authenticity he played his role; the 2nd is Khaled el Sawy in the role of Hatem the GAY ,I see a new star is born.<br /><br />The biggest Bomb of all is (young) Marawan Hamed, if I did not know for a fact that he only had a couple of 'court met rage' I would have thought he was a veteran movie director.<br /><br />In all the movie is a gr8 & a worthy addition to the Egyptian movie Industry.<br /><br />I think in all fairness that this movie should go to the Osracs.

Normally when it comes to voting for movies on the IMDb, I'm quite liberal. I don't set very high standards for movies. I always tend to rate films based on how much I enjoy them and this means that most of the time I always rate films highly cos I try and find something good in every film I see. I saw this film when I was vacationing in England. BBC One actually transmitted this at 11 PM, since they believed that The Peacemaker was a film more deserving of the 9:00 slot. Unlike the Peacemaker, Shooting Fish is a film that almost anybody would enjoy, unless he/she was the kind of person who found simple effective storytelling a turnoff.<br /><br />Everything about this movie seems in perfect harmony. The chemistry between Dan Futterman and Stuart Townsend is perfect, word for word. And Kate Beckinsale is a perfect third piece to the puzzle; When the conversations in the movie occur, you never get the feeling you're watching a contrived conversation written by someone else, you get the feeling you're watching real life unfold. That's a hallmark of a good scriptwriter and the people who wrote this deserve credit for the story.<br /><br />As for the story itself, it never lets itself become too complicated and lends itself to a lot of funny situations. Fast-talking Dylan and socially naive Jez (Futterman and Townsend) are two con men trying to raise money to build their dream house. They end up enlisting Georgina's (short-haired Kate Beckinsale in a beautiful role from her pre-Hollywood Glamourpuss days) help on a particular scam. Soon she discovers what they're up to and the story unfolds from there, with both Dylan and Jez seemingly falling for Georgie. Here again, the movie doesn't nosedive and morph into a conventional love story; rather, the romance builds in a backdrop to the main story and culminates in a heartwarming finale. As for Dan and Jez, some of their schemes may not be very believable and yet you cant help but be amused by the way they go about implementing them. <br /><br />This film is a good reason why small budget comedy romances are popular - simply put, they work. On every level. Watching this film gives you the same kind of feeling as watching While you were Sleeping, for example. For the sheer sweetness of the film and for Kate Beckinsale's performance, I'd give it 7 on 10.

Having read the novel almost a year ago, I was very impatient to watch the movie knowing the magnificent cast lined up to put their talent on display for that movie. I was surprised when I found out that the younger actors/actresses have matched - and sometimes- exceeded their older and more famous counterparts. Hend Sabry continues her breath-taking displays with a very natural and heart-touching impersonation of Bouthina, the poor little girl who find herself surrounded by a crucial mother asking her to bring money home regardless of how she does so and numerous men trying to use her body to satisfy their sexual desires. Adel Imam & Nour El Sheriff put the wisdom of years of acting into producing very real characters from the Egyptian society. What came as a a surprise is Adel Imam's son in real life (The bawab's son who become a terrorist) and Khaled El Sawy (The Gay). No matter what you say about gays, Khaled El Sawy faces the difficult task of making you hate him and then sympathize with him as he recalls the lack of attention he got from his parents that caused him to become a gay. Also the scene where he tries to convince the soldier that he takes back home that being gay is not 7aram and that its 7allal. I think this would be his best ever role and he proved himself as a capable actor today. I would say a 9 over 10 and a new record for Egyptian Cinema. A Must See.

I just saw "The Yacoubian Building" last night. Let me first say that it was an ambitious, well-acted film . Ultimately, though, despite the three hours running time, I walked away unsatisfied, defeated by the film's ambition. In an effort to bring all the problems facing Egypt to light, the filmmaker has stretched himself too thin. Each of the topics addressed: the plight of women, homosexuality, corruption, fundamentalism, etc., could easily have been its own full-length film. I was particularly concerned with the fundamentalism segment of the movie. The character and his motivations were too undeveloped to understand his convictions and his actions, and I feel that it is irresponsible to release such a superficial overview to the West. I am worried that this portrayal may help cement some Westerners' anti-Arab view (while I understand that the intention was completely opposite). Overall, as mentioned earlier, I thought that this has the potential to be a fabulous series of movies, but all thrown together, it leaves something to be desired.

If I compared this movie with all Egyptian movies, i'd give it 10. What's different about this one ? Same actors. that's about it. Everything else is specially different. I've never seen such performance. Lighting, music, clothing, decor, lighting again and editing.<br /><br />There is a theme given to every characters that is shown by camera positioning, specially the background. no stupid close-ups like Egyptians love. no clown makeup on every actor and actress. no exaggerations. No on-stage-like acting in real-life situations (you'll only know what i mean if you've seen enough).The screen writer who is also the director is brilliant.<br /><br />However, the story itself has no obvious target. the end is something like "and so on. no comment" or "Life goes on. stay still"!! it just shows you events and people. it's OK but not what i expected.<br /><br />This is my first review so... thanks for reading

Egypt has the same problems as in any other country. The difference with this film is that these problems are laid out bare.This may be unique in Egyptian cinema.<br /><br />Although the film is very good, the director tried too hard to include so much! Every subplot in this movie could have been turned into a film.<br /><br />The only negative thing is the portrayal of the homosexual. Though shown to be kind and sensitive (unlike most characters in the film), it is implied that he had been forced into being gay. Why can't we just expect that some people are just naturally gay!

Omaret Yakobean is one of the best Egyptian movies in the last decade, it's a story of the stories of the people living in the large legendary historian building of Yakobean. Yakobean building was built by Hagoub Yakobean the greatest of the Armenians in Egypt in 1937, since then, different kinds and cultures of people lived in that building, Princes and Princesses, bashas, Rich and Tycons, foreigners, Officers of revolution, Ordinary people and even Jews. The story of the movie is in the first half of the 90's of the 20th century where different kinds of people who have different cultures and sorts of life, The main characters in the movie were: - Zaki El Dessouki (Adel Emam): A desperate old man descended from a former basha and a Tycon. now in the age of 65, he's living a lonely life only to enjoy himself with women and girls of different types, finally he found the true love with Bothayna (Hend Sabry) and suffering from the annoying of his half mad sister Dawlat (Essad Youniss) ..<br /><br />- Haj Azzam (Nour El Seriff): An old tycoon started from zero, wanted to play a politic role but was lost and surrendered in the middle of corruption that rules the game of politics ..<br /><br />- Taha (Mohamed Emam): a low level young man failed to achieve his dream to become a police officer, instead he joined a radical cell who doesn't really understood the true meaning of the great religion of Islam and became a terrorist and finally died while trying to kill the police officer who once tortured him when he was captured and jailed ..<br /><br />- Bothayna (Hend Sabry): a poor girl who was forced to become a whore serving the ugliest kinds of people to have the money to live and finally found Zaki El Dissouki who gave her the power and the true meaning of love and finally married him - Hatem Rasheed (Khaled El Sawy): A great chief editor in the journal d'Egypt magazine who is living his life as a desperate homosexual and trying to find a guy to satisfy his sick needs and tends ..<br /><br />A strange mix of characters which were perfectly managed by a strong story and a great and promising director (Marawan Hamed) Really a worthy movie to be seen as it reflects a hard criticism to some corrupted situations of politics, sexual lives and terrorism *** Lo'ay

The modern day Egypt is the main character of this epic. It seems to be a tumultuous place never sure if it wants to be in the West or East. The director of this interesting movie tackles quite a few controversial topics. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism, homosexuality, the poor treatment of women in contemporary Egyptian society, the rampant corruption, still powerful strict class system. Enough topics for a dozen movies, but the director somehow manages to pull it all together. Some of the story lines feel a bit rushed to its conclusion, but all in all an interesting glimpse at modern Arab world. Its people are like any other, scared and imperfect and a bit lost in the complexities of life.

What I like most about this movie is that it opens a window into an unknown world for me, that of relations between men an women in modern Egypt, and it does so in a style that is at the same time sumptuous an unfamiliar. People do things you wouldn't expect, despite the slightly heavy-handed handling of emotions. There are areas where the movie is not perfect: it is so highly pessimistic and denounces the greed and selfishness of Egyptian men with so much vigor that it appears somewhat simplistic. It does tend to ramble a bit. But the power and the humor of the movie (it is quite funny, despite being tragic) transcends all that and makes those minor faults. I understand the director is very young, so he will have ample time to overcome and transcend these youthful imperfections. I didn't like Slumdog Millionaire because it told me everything about India that I already knew: it feels like a package tour where you are shown the sites you expect to see, and are whisked from one location to another. For a western viewer, Omaret yakobean is like a journey where you land at the airport and are immediately carried away by the atmosphere, the culture shock, the bustling streets, the misunderstandings, from which you emerge with challenged assumptions and a wider view of the world.

"The Yaboubian Building" reminded me of those over-heated Spanish soap operas that air nightly on Telemundo. The sweep and size of the film (not to mention its length) may fool people into thinking it's a more important picture than it actually is, when really it's not much more than one big soapy melodrama that manages to stay mostly entertaining over the course of its three hours.<br /><br />There's a lot going on in this film, and you may find you have your work cut for you just following the basics of the plot. I suspect much more of the film would have made sense to me had I known more about Egyptian culture. As it is, there are a lot of terms and situations in the film that probably didn't have their full desired effect. Of course, it's tough as an American, and therefore one used to experiencing art that throws critical darts at my country's beliefs and institutions, to fully understand how controversial this film (and the book on which it is based) has been in Egypt. By all accounts, the frank candour about corrupt government, homosexuality and the prostitution of Egyptian citizens (of all types and at all levels of society) have been greeted with quite an uproar in this film's country of origin. It's a noble effort on the part of the film-makers, and I can understand them wanting to pack in as much punch as they can, but the film tries to do too much, and the plot feels like several different agendas unsuccessfully unified into a coherent whole.<br /><br />Much of "The Yacoubian Building" is no less ham-fisted than your typical Hollywood film, not the least of which are the scenes that explain outright the film's central metaphor (the Yacoubian building itself as a representation of Egyptian society). But much of it works quite well too, especially the acting, which is pretty good across the board, the crisp pacing and the driving musical score.<br /><br />A big bold movie that bites off more than it can chew but provides a solid few hours of entertainment nonetheless.<br /><br />Grade: B+

I am still reeling from the dizzying marvel of the grand storytelling of this movie. No movie can be like a book. So I discount all who compare it to a book.<br /><br />I cared so much for these people, their stories are topical yet universal. The anguishes, the struggles, the personal demons, stay with me...as reminders of the pain of all mankind.<br /><br />"We are living in the age of deformity" said one of the characters... and so mankind still continues, forming, deforming, renewing itself. When will it end? These are the questions which this film asks of us all. But is the world deformed or - is it we who are deformed? While this movie will not answer such an unanswerable question out loud. We know the truth. But we seldomly face it...Some of us learn our lessons, some do not. But our pasts always come back to haunt us...<br /><br />I know I've not said anything about the acting, nor the unmatched technical gifts of this movie...but they are what crown this magnificent achievement from the first delicate frame until it's bleak uncompromising ending...<br /><br />The cinematography, editing, and music must be praised to the rooftops!<br /><br />***** I recommend this movie to those who are not afraid to see the truth and see it told marvelously.<br /><br />...

man oh man. what a film; it will leave you dazzled and amazed upon it's beauty. Marwan Hamed is no ordinary director, he is one of the best around. i have never seen such a movie that tackles every issue in the Egyption society so honestly. it is a pure masterpiece and if i was running the Oscars then that movie will sure receive one. A movie so honest and directed, it is designed for all classes describing the social corruption in todays society - not only in Egypt but all around the world. if you miss this movie then you will spend your entire life regretting it so i advice every Arabic and non-Arabic speaker to watch the masterpiece and enjoy the art of this marvelous director whom i have a great respect for. two thumps up

Take a couple of con men who see an opportunity to separate a mark from his money in just about everything, throw in an attractive young woman with an altruistic agenda, blend together for about ninety-three minutes and the result is `Shooting Fish,' an amiable, entertaining comedy, directed by Stefan Schwartz. It's the story of two guys who grew up in orphanages on opposite sides of the ocean, Dylan (Dan Futterman) in America, Jez (Stuart Townsend) in England; and who, by the time they had reached the age of consent, had each been endowed with a particular talent: Dylan has the gift of gab, Jez is a technical wizard. Dylan's gift has quickly gotten him into hot water with the wrong kind of people, however, and to stay healthy (read: `Alive') he flees to England, where he meets Jez. And it's a friendship/partnership born in scam/scheme heaven. If there's a way to make a fast buck, they know it-- from selling bogus computers, to selling insulation for homes that's never installed, to entering any and every contest that comes down the pike. If there's a nickel in it, they're in.<br /><br />	Then one day they hire a girl from the temp pool to help them out with one of their scams. Georgie (Kate Beckinsale) is beautiful, smart, and has a cause she's trying to fund, so she needs the job; but from day one she's on to what Dylan and Jez are trying to pull. She stays on board, however, when Dylan convinces her that they are something like modern day Robin Hoods-- that the money they're `raising' is going to orphans. What he doesn't tell her is that the `orphans' he's referring to is them. And Dylan is a born salesman-- not to mention the fact that he's a real charmer-- and the three of them become a real team. <br /><br />	Schwartz delivers a film that is in no way exceptional nor particularly memorable, but it is entertaining. It's exactly what it promises to be: a diverting hour and a half or so that provides some laughs and a good time. It's pleasant fare that's inoffensive and features some engaging performances and a story that will keep you involved. There are a couple of scenes, in fact, that are downright hilarious. And Schwartz has good timing and sets a pace that keeps it all moving right along, which, when you add it all up, makes for a satisfying, enjoyable experience.<br /><br />	Futterman has a winning personality and a resonant, mesmerizing voice that fits his character perfectly. Dylan is the salesman you hope you'll never meet, because if you do, chances are you'll walk away with the deed to the bridge. He's a likable heel, convincingly brought to life by Futterman (who is probably best known for his role of Vincent Gray in the `Judging Amy' TV series). It's a good performance, and one of the strengths of the film.<br /><br />	As Jez, Townsend does a fine job, too, and though he's overshadowed a bit by Dylan-- intentionally the flashier of the two-- Jez is the one who secures the sympathy of the audience. After all, this is the guy who at least seems a bit remorseful as he's taking other people's money and trust. And it's interesting to compare Townsend's fairly reserved performance here with his role of the vampire Lestat in the more recent `Queen of the Damned.' He's a fine young actor whose style contrasts nicely with Futterman, and along with Beckinsale they make quite the team of scam artists.<br /><br />	The one who draws the attention, however, is the lovely and charismatic Kate Beckinsale, who is beguiling in the role of Georgie. She makes her character accessible, and plays her with a savvy, rather than naive sensibility, and it's a portrayal that works well. Most importantly, she makes Georgie real, with a winsome appeal that makes you care about her and what happens to her. She's the most grounded of the trio, and it's her character that keeps the story within the realm of credibility. This may not be the stuff Oscars are made of, but it's an enjoyable, engaging performance that will win you over, without question.<br /><br />	The supporting cast includes Rowena Cooper (Jez's Teacher), Myles Anderson (Jez, aged 8), Jacob Macoby (Dylan, aged 8), Jane Lapotaire (Dylan's Headmistress), Tom Chadbon (Mr. Greenaway), Phyllis Logan (Mrs. Ross), Peter McNamara (Geoff), Arabella Weir (Mrs. Stratton-Luce), Nickolas Grace (Mr. Stratton-Luce) and Claire Cox (Floss). An easy-going comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes, `Shooting Fish' is a solid, feel good film that will put a smile on your face and provide a pleasant evening's entertainment. And in the final analysis, that's not such a bad deal; and it's all a part of the magic of the movies. I rate this one 7/10.

That's what I felt after watching that movie, it's really close to the society and the public's pulse, some overestimation is there but through comic frame, you'll enjoy watching that movie Marwan Hamed is not an ordinary director, he is one of the best around. i have never seen such a movie that tackles every issue in the Egyption society so honestly. it is a pure masterpiece and if i was running the Oscars then that movie will sure receive one. A movie so honest and directed, it is designed for all classes describing the social corruption in todays society - not only in Egypt but all around the world. if you miss this movie then you will spend your entire life regretting it so i advice every Arabic and non-Arabic speaker to watch the masterpiece and enjoy the art of this marvelous director whom i have a great respect for. two thumps up

I read the story of Yacoubian Building so I couldn't wait to watch it in the movie theater but I thought it will be like any other story. not as good as the book. I just loved this movie.. the Casting was so genius and every actor did his part in an amazing way. The Old Classic ones and the new generation. Even Mohamed Emam. this is his first movie and he was able to make me believe in him. This movie should be nominated for an Oscar. Even the soundtrack, the picture and the dialog just so good. this movie had me thinking all night about it and made me live it. this movie made me laugh, cry, bothered, It is a masterpiece. I just hope the movie industry in Egypt keeps on bringing those types of movies. those movies which remind us of the 70's movies where at least 2 or 3 big movies stars act together. Now I'm thinking to take the rest of my friends to it so i can be able to watch it second time. It is one of the best movies I've watched this year.

This excellent black drama is a must see despite its nearly three-hour running time, the movie is one of the most watchable and enjoyable pieces of art in Egyptian Cinema.<br /><br />I didn't read the story before seeing that controversial movie, so I had low expectations. But despite that, got hooked as early as the quality intro that takes you smoothly through an enjoyable ride to discover the background behind that nostalgic building in central Cairo through a Sepia short clip.<br /><br />The film is an artistic black drama which is full of cultural and political symbolism if you read carefully between the lines, my interpretation is that the building is a clear symbol of the country itself and how it transformed dramatically from the nostalgic early days of the 40s till the present day, shedding light on the price that the Egyptian society had to pay during that rough trip, and how the society has clear double standards that everyone is trying to ignore.<br /><br />Every side story evolves in a different direction and involves controversial characters who are linked only by the same building (society) in someway or the other, the different stories are interweaves in an artistic way to dramatise different controversial issues and taboos from adultery, political corruption, homosexuality to Islamic fundamentalism.<br /><br />The movie has a general sad feel around it especially for anyone who lived in Egypt as it touches on the deterioration and many negative issues that are becoming more and more the norm in most Egyptian society levels that was once a conservative and religious society. It is strong wakeup call to those who love their country to stop burying their heads in the sand when it comes to double standards that's affecting everyone in the society making everyone feel inferior to the country. The story will make you think deeply about how and why a country like Egypt could end up where it is today.<br /><br />The cinematography, steady cams, crane camera movement is brilliant, the smooth cuts and soft transitions boosts the romantic dimension of the storyline. As expected, the music score by Khaled Hammad is expressive, romantic and adds a lot of depth to many scenes. The tempo of the movie is just right, giving enough time for actors to express their feelings through longer than usual shots that will never leave you bored. Action scenes are also very well done.<br /><br />A must see piece of art for anyone who is living or used to live in Egypt.

Omaret Yakobean is my new favorite movie because well everything about it is done perfectly, as in acting, music, storyline, characters... Also, it tackles so many issues and problems in the Egyptian society from corruption, to prostitution to homosexuality to many other things, things that the Egyptian cinema has been too conservative, or "shy" to handle because they are all taboo. But no! this movie tackles all these issues in an upfront and honest, yet classy and sophisticated way. However I have to point out that Mohammad Imam's performance was somewhat shaky, but he overall gave an OK performance for his first movie. On the whole, this movie is a breakthrough for the Egyptian cinema and in my opinion the best movie ever made in the history of the Arab cinema. Hopefully, more movies of that genre will be made in the future because every second of that movie was entertaining in every aspect and i was enjoying it until the very last second, and i even didn't want it to finish.this movie is just BEAUTIFUL!!!

January 2002. Alaa el Aswani's first novel, Omaret Yacoubian, is published. Within a few months, it has taken the Egyptian book world by Storm. And it's easy to know why. The book is almost exclusively about the 3 taboos in the Arab literature; Politics, Sex (Hetero and Homo), and Religion.<br /><br />Fast forward to June 2006. Unless you've been living on another planet for the past 2 years or so, you must've heard of the movie adaptation of the book. Seriously, it was nearly impossible to escape the following headlines "Yacoubian is the biggest Egyptian film of all-time", "De Niro says the film is a masterpiece", "Yacoubian gets huge raves at Cannes", etc... In my opinion, that was one of the film's biggest problems; the filmmakers set the bar too high for themselves. So, I walked in expecting to see a breakthrough in film-making. What I got was a great, although flawed, film. So, I was somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />I didn't like Wahid Hamed's adaptation of the book. The spirit of the novel is there, and the film is much more humorous, but unfortunately, that was it. Maybe because Hamed had to fit the script, so that the bigger stars get the bigger parts, all the secondary characters (Soaad, Dawlat, Malaak, etc...) ended up with almost no screen time. Therefore, these characters came off as 2 dimensional and their actions didn't make a lot of sense. For example, in the book, Soaad is almost a beggar. She constantly asks her friends and relatives for money. In the film, she's a middle class secretary. That's why I never understood why she would agree to be separated from her own son, and marry an older man just for some cash. Another example would be how someone came out of nowhere to kill off one of the main characters.<br /><br />Director Marawan Hamed did a great job. Yacoubian is his first full-length feature, but he helmed it like a veteran. His camera moved smoothly, his cuts were all in the right places, and he shined in the large-scale (protest, training, and shootout) scenes. I'm really looking forward to his next picture.<br /><br />Adel Emam (Zaki el Dessouky) was amazing. His turn (his best in ages) was funny yet heartfelt. Khaled Saleh (Kamal el Fouli) and Khaled el Sawy (Hatem Rashid) were also great. In fact, I think Mohamed Emam (Taha el Shazly) was the only cast member who gave a so-so performance. Anyway, he's still a newbie (this is his first film), so he'll probably give better performances in the future. <br /><br />Yacoubian is one of the most expensive Egyptian films of all-time, and fortunately, the money is on the screen. The costumes, make-up and sets are all top-notch. Khaled Hammad's score was good, but I felt it was overly dramatic in some places (a full Orchsetra playing while 2 people are merely talking?)<br /><br />So, I'd definitely recommend watching The Yacoubian Building. It's the best Egyptian film in quite some time, and with a better adaptation, it could have been a masterpiece.

"They" say it's overly faithful to the bestselling novel by Alaa Al Aswany which I have not read. . For Egypt, Yacoubian Building is the most expensive film ever (quotes vary). Director Hamid was 28 when he made it and is the son of the screenwriter who did the adaptation. The film is an ambitious and promising if under-edited piece. Perhaps it ought to have been in parts like Marco Tullio Giordana's The Best of Youth/La meglio gioventù, to which it has been compared. But instead it's a somewhat sprawling 172 minutes and feels at times like a smashed-together telenovela.<br /><br />Hollywood Reporter says the film may "offer a revealing window into the secular world of a modern Islamic country -- its indulgence in alcohol, sexual promiscuity, political corruption and personal betrayals. From such 'deformities, the movie argues, Islamic fundamentalism gains its most passionate adherents." But we can do better than this crude analysis. Moroccan-born ,western educated novelist Laila Lalani points out the book (and consequently the movie) is full of prejudices against gays, resembles the old "large-scale melodramas" produced by Egypt's "huge film industry," with their "young idealists, desirable ingénues, old predators, and so on," and is crudely moralistic -- with almost every character forced to make choices that "ultimately result in either their downfall or redemption." It's also full of heavy-handed emotional manipulation, cliff-hangers, and so on. Alaa Al Aswany is no Naguib Mahfouz. Aside from the prejudice against gays, we're told that mixed marriages produce confused children, that all women love sex enormously, and so on. It's important to realize that however engaging the film is and notable the actors are in the Egyptian film world, it's made out of dross, not gold.<br /><br />The titular Armenian-owned, Twenties Yacoubian Building in the once elegant, restricted central zone of the city "became home to Cairo's rich and powerful when it opened," Lalani writes. After the revolution, however, "storage sheds on the rooftop were rented out to poor families--a sort of sky-high slum." This allows for a story about the building's residents that spans society. The action is set in the 1990's. And the basic panorama goes something like this:<br /><br />In the foreground is Zaki Bey El Dessouki, or "Zaki Pasha" (Adel Imam), a superannuated playboy kicked out of the family apartment by his mean, half-crazy sister. He may seem seedy, but he's the house aristocrat. Fanous (Ahmed Rateb) is his faithful manservant. Dawlat (Essad Younis) is his nutty, vindictive sister, who has always resented his fun loving ways and not is out to get him. Hatem Rasheed (Khaled El Sawy) is a gay editor who takes a good-looking soldier Abd Raboh (Bassem Samra) .from the country as his lover. Rasheed isn't mincing, but he reflects an Egyptian discomfort with gayness; still, he's seen three-dimensionally. He likes dark Nubian men because they remind him an early experience with a family servant. The film's treatment of the sexual aspect of Hatem's relationship to the soldier feels like something made in the 1950's. In general sex is a burden for the people in this movie, either a risky temptation or an ordeal. It gets nasty, and then the camera shrinks away.<br /><br />Haj Assam (Nour El Sheriff) is a self-made millionaire (through a chain of stores selling modestly-priced women's clothing) with political ambitious. wants to get into the People's Assembly (Majlis al Sha'ab) for access to power. He takes a penniless young widow with a young son, Soad (Somaya el Khashab), as a second wife and forces her to have an abortion. As Lalani puts it, Assam "is the nouveau riche to Zaki' Bey's aristocrat." The brothers Abaskharon and Malaak (Ahmed Bedire) are Coptic Christians who save every penny they make, by legal and illegal means, in order to finally afford a room on the roof.<br /><br />On the roof are Taha (Mohamed Imam)and Buthayna (Hind Sabry). Taha is the son of a bawab. A bawab is a doorkeeper, more like a concierge or a super in New York rather than "janitor" as it's translated. With such a lowly father, Taha is turned down by the police academy as not socially adequate to become an officer, and adopts a "plan B," to major in political science, which leads him to sympathy with the university religions fanatics and he eventually becomes an Islamic fundamentalist. His girlfriend Buthayna leaves him when he becomes religious and eventually she goes to work for Zaki, who's reformed and treats her well. She's previously been sexually harassed in every job she's had -- as we're shown in a lurid scene. Perhaps she feels too defiled to be worthy of one so innocent and decent as Taha, and she seems hardened A reader has pointed out that she is much poorer in the book than here. Laila Lalani says, "Egypt's young men are easy preys to religious extremism while the country's young women are victims of sexual exploitation." Taha is imprisoned and given Abu Ghraib treatment that de-islamicizes him. To get revenge, he trains as a terrorist -- a chain of events that looks frighteningly up-to-date.<br /><br />The film has little details any Cairo downtown resident will know -- like Zaki yelling angrily because another resident has left the door of the antique elevator open on their floor so no one else can use it. Though this isn't Naguib Mahfouz, like him it attempts to draw a richly representative picture of a whole society. It's a rather sad picture with its disapproval of the present and nostalgia for the past.. And again, despite the three or six million dollars spent, some exterior sound is awful, the wrong kind of lens is used to pan up and down the city buildings, and some of the Islamicists' beards look pasted on. But with all that's going on, it holds your attention.<br /><br />Shown as part of the San Francisco International Film Festival 2007. Earlier in the year one of the Film Comments Selects series at Lincoln Center, New York.

This movie is no different from any other Oscar winning film. What I have witnessed is far beyond any Egyptian movie. This film has successfully captured all of the dysfunctional aspects of Egyptian society, squeezed taboos to the last drop, and left the audience laughing from the heart. I expected it to be good but not this good it's amazing go watch it, support decent movies for a change. 3 hours but couldn't keep my eyes off of it. I'm really hoping that this film wins an Oscar to show Egyptian film makers that hard work does pay off. Films like zay elhawa and elghawas should not be in theaters, unless products contain effort, the audience should not have to put up with it.

I've watched this video well over 10 times. The sound is great. The Lighting is amazing. The song selection is better than I could of imagined. Definitely one of my all time favourite concerts. Her special guests are a treat too. "go Bruce Hornsby/Kim Wilson"

Bonnie Raitt is one of the finest musicians from the USA. With this concert-registration "Road Tested" she proofs her qualities beyond any doubt. It's an evening full of great songs and beautiful duets with Bruce Hornsby and Jackson Browne. The performances of "come to me" and "feeling of falling" are just fantastic ! It's like she proudly says herself : "That's the band I like" !!

I rate it a 10 by how it affected me when I first saw it on television years ago, probably '78 or '79. I've only seen it once, yet I still remember it, and thanks to IMDb, I finally found the info on it. It might be horrible if I viewed it now, some things don't hold up well through the years. That being said, all I can remember is laying on the floor watching the television and beating the carpet I was laughing so hard, and my best friend called screaming through the phone, wheezing like he was going to die--he was watching it also. We didn't throw up, but we definitely couldn't breathe, it was that good at the time. I hope it comes out someday on DVD so I can give it the test. Until then, I still fondly give it a 10. (And Leonard Maltin is not right a lot of the time! Don't let him sway you.)

Bonnie Raitt does not mean much in England and I can never figure out why. There are fans, of course, but she never seems to achieve the profile she deserves. Maybe her music is too American (it is, of course, but thats no bad thing). I love her second only to Joni Mitchell. This DVD is knockout-she genuinely loves what she does and does it supremely well. That love of her music it comes through in this stunning live performance. She is surrounded by musicians to die for. I was on holiday this year when she appeared at a nearby venue-it broke my heart-I have yet to see her live-but this concert is a wonderful second best!!

I have seen this film so many times and never get sick of it. The casting is brilliant with Dan Futterman and Stuart Townsend in fantastic performances.<br /><br />The plot is quite original following Dylan and Jez - two English con artists who are tricking people out of their money by selling voice recognition computers and other false devices. They need two million dollars to buy the house they never had - having grown up as orphaned children. On one of their scams they employ a secretary and medical student named Georgie, who is convinced they are raising money for an orphans project. This adds romantic themes into the story to make it even more entertaining. A stand out is the interesting relationship that Dylan and Jez have with each other, Dylan being the fast talking American and Jez being the British techno genius.<br /><br />I recommend 'Shooting Fish' to all movie-goers. It has a great soundtrack, is funny, romantic, creative and a great achievement for British filmmaking.

Bonnie is simply the best among all female r&b vocalists (and anything else...). During her Cincinnati concert in fall of 2004, I was blown away by the juiciness of her guitarin', vibin', and singing plus the band was superb to boot. It was a big-time head trip and certainly a good time was had by all, even among those over 50 who were groovin' in the aisles and friggin' shaking it!!! Having watched the DVD numerous times, I'm always struck by the harmonies that can be easily followed and I join in every time. "I Can't Make You Love Me" is always poignant as ever. Bruce Hornsby plays the accompaniment so well, as always. I am on the constant lookout for her next concert. Because, ...Bonnie rocks, period.

Bonnie Raitt is one of the greatest American musician. Her guitar and her voice are astonishing and unique. The concert 'Road Tested' is remarkable: I have the double CD, the VHS and now I have just bought the DVD. The selection of song is perfect and it is impossible to select the bests: 'Thing Called Love (with Bruce Hornsby)', 'Something to Talk About', 'Love Letter', 'Never Make Your Move Too Soon', 'Shale a Little', 'Matters of the Heart', 'Have a Heart', 'Love Me Like a Man', 'Louise', 'Dimming of the Days', 'My Opening Farewell (with Jackson Browne)', 'Longing in Their Hearts', 'Come to Me', 'Love Sneakin'Up On You' 'Burning Down the House', 'I Can't Make You Love Me', Feeling of Falling', 'I Believe, I'm In Love With You', 'Rock Steady' and 'Angel From Montgomery'. How to choose better songs among such a wonderful repertoire? However, my favorite one is the wonderful blues 'The Kokomo Medley', which I do not get tired of listening to it. I regret only that the DVD does not have the option of Lyrics On (or at least Closed Caption). Bonnie Raitt's fans did not deserve such a lack of care from the producers and distributors. But my vote is ten.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Bonnie Raitt: Road Tested"

You get a lot for your money here: about an hour and three-quarters of Bonnie Raitt songs, her hits and otherwise. Just about every song is a winner because her voice fits her blues- rock material extremely well and her band is outstanding. She comments at one point about her band being the "best" their is, and she may not be far off. <br /><br />There is so much music here I often break this up into a couple of viewings, but no matter where I pick this back up in the concert, it's a good starting point because it's simply one good song after another. You'd except a dud here or there, but it's just not the case.<br /><br />The first part of the concert has more upbeat songs, so it you want a 45-minute fast-moving mini-concert, the first nine songs will do well. It's a good workout disc, too! Later on, Raitt goes through several slow songs in a row and the tape ends with the slow-but-dramatic "Angel From Montgomery."<br /><br />Guests include Bruce Hornsby, Jackson Browne, Bryan Adams, Kim Wilson and the old blues couple Ruth and Charles Brown. All of them are excellent, as well. <br /><br />The only thing missing in this DVD is more colorful camera-work. That would have really made this a spectacular concert disc. Hey, the the music is the main attraction here anyway, so I am not complaining. I used to own this on VHS but acquired the DVD because of the better sound. <br /><br />Obviously, this is very highly recommended.

Desperation hangs over this story until the very end! The family's home is a Chicago tenement, and the dad is pictured as a real loser. Mother and child are leaving to stay with relatives until better times happen. Repeated phone calls are no help, and the Long Distance charges result in an order for a disconnect. When the final phone call comes through (thanks go a kind-hearted phone lineman,)the news is bad, and the Duryea character contemplates suicide. Yet the very illogical ending countermands the whole story and leaves one with a feeling of "This could never happen in real life!" A parallel plot can be found in "Night Into Morning" with Ray Milland. I would so like to find this movie on tape or DVD.

I saw "Chicago Calling" sometime in the 1950's. I was a kid at the time. I have seen this movie only that one time; it left an indelible impression on me. I really FELT for this man who was waiting for a phone call to find out the status of his wife and child -- who were in a car accident. Whenever I hear the name of the actor, Dan Duryea, I recall his amazing, heart-wrenching performance in this film. And I remember the ANXIETY Duryea's character endured; that his telephone -- while waiting for this crucial call -- was going to be disconnected for non-payment. Since that first and only time of seeing this movie, I have had a desire to see it again -- as an adult. I'm curious to see if it will still affect me so strongly. Fifty years of living since seeing it -- no doubt -- will make it a different viewing experience. It's been a few years since I checked to see if it's available now in any format. I hope it will someday be available . . . HOLD THAT THOUGHT! I just Googled it and see that it IS now available in VHS or DVD format!!! WOW! I am going to order it as soon as I post this message! I'm very excited about this! I'm not kidding. This is a sincere post!

You might want to have a handful of mood elevators handy when you watch this one.<br /><br />Duryea is out of work, and his wife takes the kid and leaves him. They are involved in an auto accident, out of town, and Duryea must wait until they are out of surgery to receive a phone call informing him as to whether they will live or die. Because his phone bill is un-paid, his phone is disconnected, and he tries in vain to earn, borrow, and even contemplates stealing the money.<br /><br />To make matters worse, his little pooch is run down in traffic.<br /><br />When the Phone Company Rep comes to pick up the instrument (this was made long before we all owned our own phones!) Duryea cons the guy into hooking him up long enough to take the long distance call from Chicago concerning the condition of his wife and kid. This is where you will really need the Prozac!<br /><br />Although this is downbeat throughout, Duryea gives an acting "tour-de-force" and if they ever show it again, it is well worth watching, but you've been warned!

Several steps in quality above the average 1950s B movie, CHICAGO CALLING is yet more testimony of the talents of Dan Duryea. In the hands of a lesser actor, this could easily have slid down into sentimentalized, feel-good territory. Duryea brings so much conviction and multi-dimensionality to the role of a downtrodden victim of bad luck, that it's almost possible to forget that the movie is fiction. This is surely one of the lanky, blond actor's finest performances on film, and it must not be missed by any fan.<br /><br />As the film opens in L.A. , Duryea's wife takes their young daughter and leaves for Chicago. Desperate pleas do nothing to stop them, and the unemployed husband and father is left with the family dog and his own devices. Later, when the telephone man (Ross Elliott) comes to remove the phone for unpaid bills, Duryea coincidentally receives a telegram reporting that his wife and daughter have had a serious auto accident and are hospitalized in Chicago. Someone will call him later to update their conditions. Duryea manages to convince Elliott to leave his phone connected for another day, until the bill is paid. This sets into motion a desperate attempt to raise $50.00--something not so easily done in L.A. of 1951. Circumstances lead to more troubles and, along the way, Duryea makes an unexpected new friend. Without spoiling it, let it be said that the plot continues in a few surprising ways. With Duryea, and some able supporting players, there is an emotional impact that is not easily dismissed. If this deserves to be classed as a film noir, it is because of a relentless pressure from the forces of fate on a hapless protagonist.<br /><br />Austrian-born Director John Reinhardt (who died two years later) keeps the film tight, suspenseful and very well paced. There is also a music score by Heinz Roemheld that, strangely, seems to recall Tchaikovsky's "Romeo & Juliet".<br /><br />This movie is also another great example of the value of location photography. Duryea actually seems to inhabit the real city. We see the blue-collar, everyday side of Los Angeles, not the glamour. It's a tough, but real place, where people work construction jobs overnight, and hot dog vendors might actually help out a desperate man. The film is titled CHICAGO CALLING, but it really lives and breathes in L.A.

It's hard to believe that Above The Line talent like Gordon Douglas, Harry Brown and Horace McCoy could fall so badly into the old Flashback trap; you know the one, one character begins to tell another or, in this case, a crowded courtroom of something that happened in the past and almost as soon as we're in full flashback mode the character narrating disappears leaving us to watch a series of events at which he was not present and by extension could have no knowledge of. Perhaps the fact that this film is now 59 years old and what was arguably fast-moving then now veers toward the pedestrian draws attention to this basic flaw. It's quite possible that viewers at the time were prepared to put up with sloppiness like this if they were caught up in the plot. Clearly it was a cynical ploy to cash in on the success of the previous year's White Heat which provided Cagney with one of his finest gangster roles. He has another good gangster role here but it's never going to get even close to Cody Jarret. Neither Barbara Payton nor Helena Carter have any real charisma as the two love interests competing for Cagney and stalwarts such as Barton McLane, Luther Adler, Ward Bond and Rhys Williams appear to be walking through it and/or phoning it in. It's certainly watchable as a filler on television which is where I saw it and it did keep me watching til the finale which, inevitably, ended in tears.

I can only echo previous reviews here on the excellence of this movie. Why IS is not better known? Because, even with a major star like Cagney, it is probably just too grim for most viewers. Many "popular" films noirs have a certain degree of romantic interest (Bogart & Bacall, or Ladd and Lake)to soften the violent elements. "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye" (a gem of a noir title if there ever was one, bespeaking a bleak, fatalistic vision) contains no romantic subplot, unless you count the Cagney character's involvement with the rich woman, which is more about greed and rebellion than love. This film is a great of example of pure noir: dark vision of damned characters rushing headlong into doom. The casting of Cagney in the lead could hardly be improved upon: he is relentlessly corrupt and arrogant. Ward Bond gives one of his most intimidating performances as a perhaps more corrupt law officer. Even Barbara Payton, the sole ray of light in this tale, holds her own in this truculent company. The courtroom framing device is effective for introducing the story as one long flashback (a hallmark of film noir) and the cinematography is suitably grim. This was presumably a follow-up to "White Heat" and was not as popular--again, because it is dour and violent, or perhaps for the general audience of 1950, this type of gangster film had seen its day. Yet, "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye" can be seen to foreshadow violent gangster films to come:"The Godfather" series "Goodfellas" or the Al Pacino version of "Scarface."

There's the great scene in "The Public Enemy" where Cagney leans against the lamppost in the rain, defining his character and persona as a force to be reckoned with. In "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye", it's the one where the oblique upward camera angle captures Ralph Cotter over the garage pit right after he dumps the body of Vic Mason (Rhys Williams). It personifies the 'stark staring nuts' quality of Cagney's character, ranking him right up there with Tom Powers and Cody Jarrett.<br /><br />The film skillfully weaves together strands of various sub plots to create a masterful gangster drama, even if it isn't as well known as Jimmy Cagney's premier movies. Teaming up Ward Bond and Barton MacLane as corrupt cops comes in stark contrast to their pairing in Bogart's "The Maltese Falcon"; it never took much time for Inspector Weber (Bond) to cave in to Cotter's demands when it meant a bigger and bigger payoff. Somehow I don't think the cheesecake calendar in Weber's office would be deemed politically correct today.<br /><br />I'm a bit apprehensive over the Holiday Carleton character, I actually found her to be somewhat pathetic, particularly when she trades lip locks with Cotter after he slaps her around with a towel. Then again right after she manages to miss Cotter with all that kitchen artillery. For Cotter to be attracted to her didn't require much of a stretch though, he was as much a womanizer as a maniac.<br /><br />Here's a puzzler. When it was revealed that Ezra Dobson was the most powerful man in the state, and that he could get the goods on anyone within twenty four hours, how is it he didn't find out that there was no such person as Paul Murphy? As mad as he was when he first discovered Cotter/Murphy and his daughter together, I wonder what he would have done if he hadn't caught the newlyweds fully clothed in separate beds. <br /><br />Even though a modern day remake of the film would find a way to eliminate those pesky plot points, I'm not sure you'll ever find a better gangster to take a powder on screen than Cagney's death scene here, in an ode to the movie's title; it was brilliant. If one didn't know better, it looks like it might have reflected a personal experience. I wonder though, if an earlier line uttered by an off screen elevator operator was meant to reference Cotter's ultimate fate when he asked - "Going down?"

If this quirky British comedy could be summed up in a word, that word would be "charming".<br /><br />The story is a simple, low-budget British one: two orphans scam as many people as they can for as much money as they can in an effort to buy the stately home they always dreamed of as children.<br /><br />Everything is going swimmingly, until they join forces with a typist, Georgie (the perfect Kate Beckinsale), and the plot leads on from there...<br /><br />The acting is perfect for the film, neither overstated nor low key, and suits the plot and style very well. The direction is quirky, but makes no new ground, and also fits the script to a tee.<br /><br />This film would be great viewing for a date (perhaps not for a lads night in), and has the simple comedy you might expect from such classic British TV series as "Only Fools and Horses", or "Last of the Summer Wine".<br /><br />It doesn't require much brain power, but is one of the best homegrown (British) comedies of recent(ish) years.

I love this genre of film because it shows many facets of life during the time in which it is depicted. The clothing, the style of filming and the cars, my absolute favorite. I have a real thing for jailbreak flicks and this one didn't let me down. How could it with James Cagney at the helm of the gang? The cast of the movie is excellent. Everyone is suited to the part they played because they were believable. I just felt comfortable with the entire production as it included all the dimensions of crime films that are needed to make it successful. Whether it was a box-office smash when it released doesn't matter today. If you enjoy a snarling, conniving crazed character played by the red-headed genius of James Cagney, you'll enjoy watching this film. P.S. Does anyone know what kind of exotic car is used in this film?

Had a chance to watch KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE and although I don't agree with the claims of some that if you must see one "crime" film, this is it, I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and that James Cagney was again terrific and on top of his game for this one. I also didn't get the feeling that this film was, in reality, WHITE HEAT 2, as some have said but it was a nifty follow up to that classic JC film. Cagney was indeed brutal and off his rocker, but it was more controlled and offset with his characters smarts and sense of humor. In WHITE HEAT, JC was just downright nuts, out of control and a lot more frightening IMHO. In KTG, Cags plays Ralph Cotter who after a daring and violent daylight prison break, uses his smarts to prove that he is no small timer and formulates a grand scheme to garner lots of cash and protection which involves crooked lawyers and crooked policemen. Cotter, in the end, is his own downfall as he goes too far and his romance with a high society girl with a very wealthy and powerful father, leads to his downfall because one thing you don't do is double-cross your moll! Excellent performance by all, including Barbara Payton and a near film stealing performance by Luther Adler as JC's eccentric and very crooked lawyer. Direction is robust and swiftly paced by Gordon Douglas and in the end, makes this film fun, breezy, yet violent, but also a very good watch.

Hi, It's actually a right hand drive car but alas I can't be positive with the identification of it. I too thought it was a Mercedes but now know it probably isn't. It could well be an Hispano Suiza though. If you do an image internet search on this car a very similar one comes up albeit with a spare wheel attached to the door but it wouldn't be unknown for this to be removed by the production company because it got in the way. What I can say though is that it can decelerate from 110mph to 20mph in half a second (ha!)I will watch this with interest.<br /><br />I agree that it is a great film though. Film4 have just shown it for the second time to my knowledge. Hope they show Love Me Or Leave Me soon, a favourite of mine and apparently of Cagney himself. In both these films Cagney was in his early 50s, being born in 1899 but still believable as a character.

I'm stunned. I just finished watching this movie, and can't believe 1) how incredible it was; 2) that I knew nothing about this film, and that it is a totally hidden forgotten overlooked minor classic. I thought I knew or had heard of every major or almost-major film from the mid 30s through the 50s, but this came as a shock. There's no point comparing it to White Heat, which is in a class all by itself, for some justifiable memorable moments, notably the finale on the oil tank. But removing that legendary scene from the equation, this film is almost as good, with many scenes that stand out. The casting is flawless, and it has its own specialness, not the least (besides an always-brilliant Cagney), are the two love-interests, both pitch-perfect - Barbara Payton as the corrupted blonde, Helene Carter is the rich spoiled debutante. Notably, the script is devoid of cliché, often surprising, witty and anachronistically violent following the pathological gangster Cagney on a lawless tear as he breaks out of prison and afterwards. Two scenes, among many, jump out from the norm for their style, as often happened in a Hitchcock film: Payton throwing coffee, sugar, etc at Cagney, during a spat; and Cagney pushing Carter's foot further on the pedal in a duel of power while she drives her sportscar. The movie was complete surprise, and quite wonderful.

"Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye" is a violent thriller which simply exudes energy. Its story is told at an exhilarating pace, James Cagney gives a superb high octane performance and the character he depicts is an incredibly driven psychopath who pursues his own agenda with an extraordinary sense of purpose and determination.<br /><br />Ralph Cotter (Cagney) is a real force of nature and his actions have a powerful effect on everyone he encounters. He's completely oblivious to the rule of law and totally cynical in his attitude to other people. Amusingly, the fact that the other characters in the story are nearly all corrupt seems in a perverse way, to almost vindicate his attitude towards them.<br /><br />Cotter is a vicious criminal who together with another convict, escapes from a prison farm. When his accomplice is injured, Cotter shoots him in the head without any hesitation or compunction to ensure that his own chance of freedom isn't jeopardised. As planned, a car is waiting for him and accompanying the driver, Jinx Raynor (Steve Brodie) is the dead man's sister Holiday Carleton (Barbara Paynton). During the exchanges of gunfire that follow, Holiday shoots a prison guard and later Cotter tells his co-conspirators that Holiday's brother was killed by one of the guards. Holiday clearly dislikes Cotter initially but after an incident where he smacks her around the head with some towels, her demeanour changes and she starts to become attracted to him and agrees to him staying at her apartment.<br /><br />Cotter and Raynor carry out a robbery and are subsequently traced by two corrupt police officers who relieve them of some money and order Cotter to leave town. Cotter later records an incriminating conversation involving the two policemen and with the assistance of a shady lawyer, turns the tables on them.<br /><br />Cotter then gets involved with another woman, the daughter of a wealthy businessman and after the couple get married and jealous Holiday discovers who killed her brother, Cotter's problems start to escalate alarmingly.<br /><br />Holiday's relationship with Cotter has an unhealthy dimension as can be seen on a couple of occasions when she responds positively to him following violent incidents. Cotter on the other hand is able to get his way by using both brutality and cunning. When necessary he uses coercion to get Holiday to fall into line with his wishes and again uses plenty of guile in order to get the upper hand with the corrupt cops.<br /><br />"Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye" is a very good movie in which James Cagney is at his brilliant best and the supporting cast all contribute fine and effective performances.

Although not up to the high standards of his previous work in "White Heat" the year before, "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye" is still a worthy follow-up for James Cagney. Whereas Cagney's Cody Jarrett in "White Heat" was a deranged psychopathic killer, his character here (Ralph Cotter) is more of a calculating cynic who plays on the fears and weaknesses of others. He's the type of ruthless criminal who could corrupt a cloister of nuns and he leaves a trail of misery wherever his path takes him. Unfortunately, he has one lovely lady named Holiday who believes all his lies and will do his bidding without question. Played by the beautiful Barbara Payton, Holiday does all she can to aid and abet Cotter until he takes away the only other person she loves in the world: her brother. That's a mistake that Cotter pays for in one of the most well-remembered death scenes in 1950's cinema. <br /><br />Veteran director Gordon Douglas keeps the brutal action moving at a brisk pace and he employs a trove of famous character actors who weave themselves in and out of the twisted plot. Ward Bond is around as a suspicious cop with a shady past. Good-looking Helena Carter plays a young and very rich socialite who Cagney takes advantage of so he can pass himself off as legitimate. Kenneth Tobey plays an honest detective and they're in short supply in this film. Barton MacLane, John Litel, Luther Adler and William Frawley (Fred Mertz from "I Love Lucy") round out the stellar cast. Director Douglas had a prolific career directing a slew of famous and not-so-famous films all the way into the late 1970's. Cagney, as always, dominates the screen whenever he appears and his performance definitely raises the level of this work quite a few notches. Without him, "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye" would've been a standard 1950's "cops and robbers" film with few redeeming values. As it stands, the movie is not a classic like some of Cagney's other gangster epics, but it certainly has its moments---especially at the end. When Ms. Payton finds out that Cagney has murdered her brother, she gets the opportunity to give new meaning to the title. She sticks a gun in Jimmy's face and spits out the words "You can KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE!"

How fickle film history is! To think that this most intense crime thriller has been totally overlooked. I wouldn't say underrated, because it seems that everyone who has watched it agrees with me.<br /><br />I woke up ten minutes before this movie started on TV, flicked the switch, and thought, OK cool, a James Cagney movie. I wasn't prepared for the roller-coaster plunge through abyssal night. Or the violent way with which the riders carom off into the void. The ending scene is totally classic with dialogue and revelation that pitches the film into the darkest reaches of noir.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is hyped, Cotter (Cagney) hasn't got a bottle of champagne, he's got a jeroboam, he hasn't got a revolver, he's got an automatic, he hasn't got one honey, he's got two, we don't do 100 kilometers per hour, we do 100 miles per hour, and in a car the size of a carnival float. The guy's a total psycho, but not in the Robert Ryan way that turns you against his character, in the Cagney way where it's all like some big game to him.<br /><br />There are a lot of totally mesmerising scenes in this movie. Two stand out just for the sheer exhilaration factor - this is the bit where you coo out loud. When Barbara (Holiday Carleton) throws a pot of coffee at Cotter he says, 'No cream?', so she throws the cream at him, 'No sugar?' so he gets the sugar, and finally 'No cigar?'. I was on the floor. Then there is the scene where Helena (Margaret Dobson) takes him out for a drive in her sporty little number. She takes it up to a hundred to scare him, and then he stamps his foot on hers and takes it to 110 whilst she frantically swerves.<br /><br />Some people have commented on how the framing device of the court-case doesn't work. But for me it's total brutality, the director doesn't waste time with the minutiae of court proceedings, he just uses them to makes plain right from the very start that its all gonna end badly. It's a complete train wreck of a movie, there isn't an honest man in sight, and the casual nature of the violence just shocks you. Cutting kills people like he's taking out the trash, it's just another chore.<br /><br />There's also classic support from Ward Bond, in this movie he always looks like he's gonna screw you up and toss you away. This role stands apart from the usual supporting roles he gets, either buffoonish (Fort Apache), ineffectual (Johnny Guitar), foolishly vigilante (On Dangerous Ground).<br /><br />OK so we got broads with pzazz, we got dialogue to die for, we got utter magnetism from the lead actor (as only Cagney can be), and we've got total, anthracitic, ebonic, pitch-black noir. 11/10

The killer in this film is the treachery of the supporting actors. I'm not one to endorse crooked cops or domestic violence, but when you see these birds in action, you understand why Cagney rules his roost the way he does.VERY underrated,very fast and colorful. Post "White Heat" and Jimmy STILL has a fresh arsenal 1 year later. A must see with a great death scene.

While this is not a great Cagney flick and it has a few silly plot elements, it is a surprisingly good film. This film immediately followed Cagney's best film (WHITE HEAT) and is a slight letdown because of this.<br /><br />Mostly I like the movie because the plot, for a Noir film, takes so many odd and difficult to predict turns--it certainly is NOT like most of the other gangster films you've seen. Cagney isn't quite the total nut case he was in WHITE HEAT, but plays a Narcissistic Antisocial criminal. He has zero regard for others and is naturally drawn to the criminal life. BUT, because of his intense narcissism (i.e., self love), he cannot imagine his complex schemes and double-dealing NOT succeeding. He certainly BELIEVES in himself! At first, this makes him a very successful hood (which feeds his ego) and so he takes another risk (feeding his ego) and another and another until he ultimately destroys himself due to his arrogance.<br /><br />So, I like the plot and interesting character study. The negative I noticed in the film is that some of the supporting cast really didn't seem like very good actors (particularly his blonde girlfriend). Maybe that's because Cagney IS the entire show.

"Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye" is about a jail convict (James Cagney) who escapes from prison and goes on the run, relentlessly pursued. He eventually winds up in a small town where he gets a girl and starts a normal life, but begins to corrupt everyone around him.<br /><br />The movie is not very well known and I'm not sure quite why. Although this movie might not be definitive film noir it surely carries certain elements of the genre, and of course it's got James Cagney in it, one of the ultimate veterans of the genre! Cagney delivers a really solid performance and comes across as both likable and despicable. We feel for him and those around him as his bad influence spreads and the tragic tale takes a turn for the worst.<br /><br />Although it's a very clear moral tale and ends up exactly where we can expect, "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye" is nevertheless a very good, underrated film whose virtually nonexistent reputation is as depressing as the film itself.

I got this movie because I wanted to see Shannen Doherty in a different element from 90210 and Charmed to determine if she could really act. The answer is: No. She displayed absolutely no emotional range in the character, hardly any visible change from a constant dead-pan expression, and no deviation from a monotone delivery of dialogue or narration. The one obvious opportunity to display any kind of emotion was when she discovered that she had been conned by a trusted friend, but no, an expression of anger seemed to be too difficult, so instead we get nothing. I mean Zero. There are numerous actors who get bottled into their TV persona, but eventually break free to prove they are talented. I really was hoping Shannen Doherty would be enjoyable to watch. She wasn't. This movie stunk.

I can't believe that this film is not well known. Get rid of the terrible courtroom framing device, and you have a gangster masterpiece. Coming on the heels of Cagney's better known White Heat, this film takes violence and corruption to a new level. This film starts off with a brutal jail break and never slows down. The cold blooded violence portrayed is quite jaw dropping. Cagney was born to play this role. He is clearly relishing his cold blooded character. The freshness of this film is surprising. You are totally caught off guard. In this sense, it reminds me most of Kiss Me Deadly. For anyone with a passing interest in Cagney, or gangster films, or film-noir, or film violence, watch this film!!!!!!!

James Cagney shines, and at times even seems to glow in the dark in this rugged follow-up to White Heat, directed with great verve by Gordon Douglas. It's a somewhat neglected film, maybe because it's basically a gangster picture rather than a noir, and rather late in the day for such things. The supporting cast features Barbara Payton; Luther Adler, in a Howard Da Silva role, as an eccentric lawyer, and who almost steals the show from Cagney; Rhys Williams, effortlessly playing an American; William Frawley, for nostalgia; and Ward Bond, neanderthal as ever, as a dogged, corrupt plainclothesman. Good, fast-paced and at times surprisingly violent, this movie will not put you to sleep.

I've seen just about everything there is to see in the world of Cinema. I've seen Rouben Mamoulian, 68years ago, create the definitive monster movie, I've seen Pekinpah's Wild Bunch go out in slo mo glory, I've seen Chow Yun Fat bleed his way through two hours, I've seen Cagney go out in a white heat at the top of the world, I've seen Belafonte lay Odds Against Tomorrow. I had honestly thought I had run out of surprises, I had seen everything worth seeing.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />I picked up, pretty much because of reviews I read here, this movie KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE. A little nothing, throwaway flick, that was done on the heels of Cagney's wildly popular WHITE HEAT, and was pretty much ignored upon release. It's said Cagney disliked the idea of doing another gangster picture. Thank goodness he decided to do it anyway, because this movie... out and out floored me!<br /><br />It's hard to call a movie from 50years ago brutal, and justify it. However that's just what this movie is, deep in the bone, teeth rattling, brutal. In a world of Scorcese and Coppola Gangster riffs, Hong Kong Cinema, Slasher movies, and the nightly news it's hard to account for this movies impact.<br /><br />There's nothing tangible in this movie, in a world of shock cinema, that one could call shocking. But yet... this movie has power, and energy, and yes a sense of brutality that blows away any dozen modern movies full of blood, or body parts.<br /><br />This movies appeal is difficult to explain, but I guess if you had to sum it up in three words, it would be Cagney...CAGney...CAGNEY!!!<br /><br />Today's movies for all their CGI brilliance lack the type of center, and ,if you like, romanticism that actors like Cagney and Bogart and Raft, and directors like Raoul Walsh, and in this case Gordon Douglass, brought to the table. Particularly in the hard-boiled flicks, a menace that was somehow felt, rather than seen, and therefore more powerful.<br /><br />I could go on, but all you need to know is that this movie in a world that has forgotten it, outgrown it, outbled it, is the finest of its breed. Better than those that came before, superior to those that came after. It is the quintessential Gangster Pic. Highest Recommendation!<br /><br />p.s. And I have to mention, I thought the courtroom scenes were well done and necessary, and everyone turned in great performances, especially the beautiful Holiday Carleton as Barbara Payton, who becomes Cagney's reluctant partner in crime. Cagney turning in his most ferocious and seductive performance, is matched by Holiday. Her tension, and wild lilting ferocity and fear, burning through the movie like a fuse, until it explodes! Mesmerizing!! A must see movie!

James Cagney pulled off one of his greatest gangster roles fairly late in his career in 1949's White Heat. You could see he was starting to get a little pudgy in the midsection and gray around the temples for that kind of role, but he still pulled it off.....big-time. What a lot of people don't remember is that he did it one more time - with this film, the following year.<br /><br />Yup, "Cody Jarrett" was in business for one more tough-guy gangster character. Here, he plays "Ralph Cotter," and he is one nasty dude. It's great to watch Jimmy doing his cocky-thug routine. I wish he could have gone on forever.<br /><br />The supporting cast, led by Ward Bond, was very good in this film and worth noting. It isn't just all Cagney. Barbara Peyton is realistic as the tough blonde and Helena Carter as the spoiled rich man's daughter. Both are decent at heart and vie for Cagney's affections.<br /><br />Included in here are crooked cops, a crooked lawyer and other assorted characters. It's a rough movie. Nobody is trustworthy in this story, which is interesting all the way. It should be better known.

A Climax of Blue Power is an excellent roughie flick as it combines hardcore porn with a storyline that is actually interesting. The story is not exactly Shakespeare, of course, but naturally most people will be tuning in for the porn and the story helps to ensure that it actually has some point, rather than just being a collection of random sex scenes, and that does benefit the film immensely. The film is somewhere between a porn flick, a cop flick and a psycho flick and the lead character is a man named Eddie; a security guard who gets his kicks during his off-hours by posing as a police officer and picking up young prostitutes. After being given a run down of what will happen to them now that they've been caught, Eddie then offers to let the girls go if they'll agree to give him a free ride - which invariably leads to a torrent of abuse for the girls. This goes on for a while until one day, while out and about, Eddie witnesses a woman kill her husband. This has an effect on the "moral and upstanding" man and after mulling over what to do; he decides to deal out his own punishment...<br /><br />The film was obviously cheaply made and naturally this has lead to a very gritty and downtrodden atmosphere, which bodes well with the hardcore sex. The sex definitely is hardcore and director Lee Frost (who previously directed odd porno-noir The Pick-Up and dismal Nazisploitation trash Love Camp 7) definitely leaves nothing to the imagination as we get to watch the lead character have his way with various female members of the cast. The sex is gritty just like the atmosphere though it well filmed and largely very erotic also. The acting does leave a lot to be desired, although Jason Carns is thoroughly convincing in the lead role. The film all boils down to the scenes at the end where we get to see the lead have his way with the murderess he witnessed earlier on and these are the best parts of the film. The film takes a bizarre turn and the sex scene towards the end is very brutal. Overall, A Climax of Blue Power certainly wont be everyone's cup of tea; but if you like your rough seventies porn with a story; this is probably one of the better examples. Recommended.

A CLIMAX OF BLUE POWER is a strong piece of 70s sleaze that is equal parts crime/drama and trashy porno. A solid entry in the lacking genre of story-driven grindhouse cinema - CLIMAX is one of the several drama/porn films that actually work on more than just an "arousal" level.<br /><br />A disgruntled and scummy security guard illegally moonlights as a real police officer in order to fulfill his sexual desires with random hookers. When our "hero" accidentally witnesses a murder take place and begins fantasizing about the crime-scene, he decides to play private-dick (literally)... <br /><br />A CLIMAX OF BLUE POWER is one of those rare 70s era porn films that actually relies on storyline and a bit of decent acting to carry the film, while still maintaing it's grimy porno atmosphere. A notable piece of drama/porn - CLIMAX works better than most similar genre entries. The porn scenes are pretty hot, while not really focusing on them as a way to validate the film. The bizarro ending is also worth noting in a weird and pretty much unexplained PSYCHO-ish turn of events (but with hardcore sex added in...). A gritty and rough piece of 70s exploit cinema - this one will be of interest to "classic" porn fans, and those that dig a whole lotta sleaze mixed in with their drama films...8.5/10

Short, blandly handsome Jason Carns, a seemingly ordinary and unassuming nice guy next door type gone horribly bug crazy wrong, gives a frightfully plausible performance as lowly security guard Eddie, who gets his twisted deviant carnal kicks by pretending to be a Los Angeles police officer who joyfully browbeats, manhandles and elicits unpaid sexual favors from street hookers while wearing a fuzzball uniform and driving around in a phony cop car. One day Carns witnesses a housewife (bewitching brunette Linda Harris) in the act of killing her no-account husband; this in turn causes the already seriously nuts Carns to go further around the bend and succumb to depraved delusional fantasies in which he has his sadistic way with Harris.<br /><br />From its shocking opening sequence depicting Carns cruelly taking advantage of a frightened prostitute to the electrifying final face-off between Carns and Harris (complete with jolting rape and an exciting last reel automobile chase), this harsh, aggressive, fiercely confrontational psycho sickie roughie porno from the late, great Lee Frost profoundly scares and unsettles, spewing forth 84 harrowing, brutality-ridden minutes that are jam-packed with plenty of nerve-jangling full-throttle dementia and perversity. Frost's blunt, no-nonsense direction, the eerie, ethereal score set to a pounding pseudo-disco beat (said score also boasts a haunting recurrent whistled theme), the flat, unpolished cinematography which adroitly captures the plain, plodding rhythms of mundane everyday life, the authentically lurid L.A. locations, several jarring visualizations of Carns' savage power trip fantasies, the mean, hard-hitting dialogue, the frequently quite startling all-out nasty rough sex tableaux, and the unusually strong and credible acting from a mostly no-name cast (the sole familiar faces are skinflick starlets Rene Bond and Uschi Digard as massage parlor girls, plus longtime Frost collaborator Wes Bishop as a detective and legendary exploitation producer Bob Cresse as the massage parlor owner) are all uniformly tops. Moreover, the film's hard, gritty, almost unbearably razor-sharp edge digs deep into the darkest, most base and disturbing wacko recesses of the human psyche. Hell, this unbeatable outing even possesses a commendably daring and provocative subtext: The flagrant abuse and mistreatment of power and authority, with especially revealing insights on role playing and how men use sex as a means to an end for totally controlling and dominating over women.

By far one of the best hardcore thrillers ever made. Lee Frosts Climax is exactly what are hardcore thriller/cop movie should be. Very well acted and exceptionally well directed by genre hag Lee Frost(partner Bob Cresse can be seen in a cameo role as a massage parlor owner)Climax feels like an old Crown International flick, except much better made than any Crown International film ever was. The cast, consisting mainly of unknown actors and actresses for the most part perfectly fit their complex roles(special acknowledgment ought to go to Jason Carns, in the lead, for he is just as convincing as any Hollywood bag guy).Continuity wise there are a few holes and gaps, but they are so small and insignificant that they can be overlooked, and are even forgotten over the course of the entire film. It is a pity that society still looks down and snubs their noses at hardcore cinema, for if this cinematic medium were to ever be accepted,surly films like this would become recognized as the masterpieces they are.

Though he tries to hide behind the pseudonym F.C. Perl, director R.L. Frost can't disguise his style in the nasty "A Climax of Blue Power." This adult film follows a security guard (Jason Carns) who's got some serious hang-ups about women. In his free time he masquerades as a cop--even going as far as converting his Ford LTD into a black & white police car--and "busts" prostitutes, offering to let them go in return for sexual favors and/or fulfilling his sadistic whims (the first victim is ordered to "crawl around in the mud like a dog!"). While bumming around the beach one day, Carns hears gunshots at a nearby house. Peeking through the windows, he witnesses a woman (Angela Carnon) murder her husband. Carnon quickly becomes the focal point of Carns' obsessions. Even a three-way in a massage parlor or watching a porno movie at home can't get her out of his mind. When he learns the murder is written off as a suicide, Carns decides the murderess shouldn't get off that easy.<br /><br />"A Climax of Blue Power" is hostile and gritty, and without a trace of political correctness. It also plays like a real movie, with a plot, characters and believable acting. There's even a car chase. Carns is effective in his role, his physical attractiveness (he sort of looks like a young Kurt Russell) never overshadowing his creepiness. Carnon, who's made numerous softcore movies ("Drop-Out Wife," "Booby Trap"), is another standout. (Incidentally, Carnon's scenes in this movie all appear to be softcore; an obvious stand-in was used for the hardcore close-ups). Also appearing are Frost's frequent producing partner Wes Bishop, as a detective, and Uschi Digard in a non-sexual and, surprisingly, fully-clothed cameo.<br /><br />Director Frost made some of the most stylish roughies of the 1960s ("The Pick-Up," "The Defilers," "Hot Spur"). "A Climax of Blue Power" essentially uses Frost's roughie template and repackages it in a hard-X format. Though the movie has a few shaky production and story issues at its beginning (like why does a hooker keep flagging down johns in front of a police car and an unconvincing day-for-night scene), this is a must for fans of Frost's work, as well as aficionados of rough sex.

I had been forewarned by those who have gone before into this unhallowed ground of what to expect, but I had no idea it would go as far as it did. There wasn't an ounce of credible acting to be had throughout the entire film. Thank God it came with English subtitles or I never would have caught on to the meager plot. If you're looking for genuinely scary, suspenseful horror, look elsewhere, because it won't be found here. What you WILL find are four women walking around a hotel naked for most of their screen time, and when they're not WALKING around naked, they're...err...hmmm...ummm...doing other things that people do when they're naked--more often than not, with each other. And the term "living dead" is horribly misused here--Mr. G. A. Romero should be able to sue them for libel. What we do see are white-robed men, most of whom are in skull-face masks, who are part of some cursed demonic cult that hangs out in an old monastery that three of the four "hotties" (their word, not mine) wander into one at a time. Upon arrival, they are branded whores and gang-raped--the third one, however, is allowed to "join them" and goes back to kill the fourth. Oh, yeah, then there's the poor girl on a chain in "the best room in the hotel". But that's another subplot that doesn't need much exposition. All in all, if you're looking for some lesbian porn, you came to the right place. But horror--nope, not here.

despite only catching the film halfway through, the time when shannons already been conned, I was luckily able to catch up quickly and thankfully did because this turned out to be a better than average TV movie. Shannon doesn't bring her A game but does enough to keep us interested, I recall years ago reading a couple of bad reviews for two of her movies at the time and I think this might have been one of them which might have put me off a little before viewing this? Regardless because I think I might decide to watch another one of her films if they turn up on TV in the near future. Although the film doesn't cross the creepy line and we don't get to see any goodies of any such nature, shannon does look remarkably good. Wasn't a fan of her in 90210 (in kelly/jennies camp) or charmed (never seen it) but loved scare tactics. like the summary states, there was one too many twists leading to the climax and it did seemed force feed as you don't really see whats happening to who and remember who was crossed etc etc.

Another underrated film, apparently a bit far off of the beaten path for most viewers. Like most Franco films this one has a good deal of atmosphere and some genuinely strange moments (and lots of nudity but not much gore). I also found the story to be well done and an interesting take on the older Blind Dead series. Franco also has some interesting things to say in the commentary on the Severin Films version, relating the dead monks in the film to his view of the Spanish Catholic church -- an insightful view, in fact, reflecting popular attitudes in Spanish Catholicism that define monks and priests as theoretically saintly figures that are also motivated by the needs and failings that drive ordinary men. I also agreed with Franco's commentaries on George Romero and his zombies (unlike a previous reviewer). I admire Night of the Living Dead for its innovative approaches, but I have always found the zombies to be very boring because in moral and intellectual terms they are complete ciphers. I've seen NotLD in at least four different decades -- and I will see it again I'm sure -- but I'm not a fan of the zombies. The living dead in Franco's film, although they could be more well-developed, are much more interesting. Kind of like the zombie "hero" in Jean Rollin's Zombie Lake who has some kind of moral sense despite his deadness.

Four strippers are sent by their travel agent to a supposed paradise which turns out to be an empty, but gorgeous location with a hotel without guests and a creepy manager, Carlos(Antonio Mayans;a frequent Franco collaborator)who keeps a naked woman, Olivia(Eva León) chained in a room, tormenting her by keeping food just out of reach. He also has a loony gardener, Marleno(Albino Graziani)who likes to pester the girls, when he's not whistling or singing to his beautiful flowers outside the hotel. But, outside the hotel, the girls notice that there are no tourists. Just the oddball Carlos and his nutty gardener. But, the girls, one by one, will soon discover who awaits them not too far from the hotel, restless spirits of accursed Inquisition dressed in monk robes, chanting from within their abbey sacrificing each female soul to Lucifer, condemned to worship him thanks to the power of a witch, Irina burnt at the stake who cast a spell on them. One of the strippers, Candy(Lina Romay, who barely ever wears clothes, I don't think I've ever seen a more uninhibited woman in all my life)could very well be the reincarnated spirit of Irina and Carlos is actually a *limbotic* spirit, real and yet unreal. When he's within the abbey walls, he's seen in a rotted form(..his face is covered in a type of waxy substance)underneath his robe, watching as his brethren takes turns sexually molesting each female victim, serving their Prince of Darkness before plunging a dagger in them. Carlos believes that if Candy is in fact Irina, her kiss to him can set their souls free, no longer to serve their dark lord.<br /><br />Well, that's what I got out this Franco flick. When he sets up the first scene as we see these "undead" monks chanting a rather harmonic tune, the wind ever present, you kind of get an idea that something within the atmosphere of this place in unstable. He is able to display this by showing the wind as it generates a type of rage, also arranging the furious sound of wind on the soundtrack. It only happens when the girls make the unfortunate mistake of nearing and entering the abbey. This is a place of unrest and, I felt, not of our realm. I was a bit miffed with the sub-plot regarding Olivia, but I think she's kept by Carlos as a reminder of what causes such discomfort, the desires of the flesh, and a longing for lustful embrace. Maybe, that's why he mistreats her. She's an outward expression of what torments him from the inside.I love the location and the desolation. Something about the absence of people creates a sense of foreboding. Where is everybody? Such a beautiful place remains so unoccupied. What gives? That worked well for me, as did the way Jess creates the atmosphere around the abbey. Many might find some of the Inquisition monks very similar to the Blind Dead Templars.There's lots of naked flesh, drooping breasts which hardly ever remain covered, and lesbian activity(Lina is a wild cat in this one, even proclaiming how she likes "tree-hugging", at one time spitting out a hair caught in her teeth).If you do not like Jess' camera work, or the way his female characters walk around naked desiring sex, stay far away.

"La Mansión De Los Muertos Vivientes" aka. "Mansion of the Living Dead" of 1985 is supposed to be cult director Jess Franco's take on Amando De Ossorio's GREAT 'Blind Dead' franchise (IMDb even lists it as a Remake of the original "La Noche Del Terror Ciego" aka. "Tomb of the Blind Dead" of 1970). However, this has about nada to do with De Ossorio's wonderful cycle which ranges among the most popular and influential Eurohorror Cult productions from the 70s. I am great fan of Jess Franco (especially of his earlier works), and had "Mansion of the Living Dead" been directed by someone else, it might not have its certain undeniable charm - then again, it is not really imaginable for anyone else to come up with an outrageously nonsensical production such as this one.<br /><br />Four young women from Germany (one of them played by Franco's real-life wife, Lina Romay) come to a Spanish beach club for vacation. In typical Franco-manner they are all nymphomaniacs with strong exhibitionist and lesbian tendencies. After one hour of walking around naked and making out with each other, one of them disappears when going out to take photos... People who are not in favor of Jess Franco's cinema will probably think of this as the worst film ever made; however, the film's incredible weirdness and lack of any logic whatsoever are also the elements that make it fun (in addition to its primary quality, the constant sleaze and female nudity).<br /><br />Basically, this film is about 90 per cent sleaze and soft porn, and 10 per cent weird and really, REALLY nonsensical Horror. Amando De Ossorio's original Blind Templars were among the creepiest creatures ever in Horror cinema; the villains in this sleazefest are a bunch of ridiculously looking monks, some of which have (extremely ridiculous) skull-faces. The original blind dead also drank their victims' blood in order to gain eternal life, whereas these guys are fans of gang-rape instead. In typical Franco-fashion, all women are naked for about 95 per cent of the screen time (one is for all her screen time, actually), which is especially welcome from the dark-skinned Elisa Vela (who goes by the name Jasmina Bell here) and Lina Romay (who has gotten a little chubbier). In typical Franco-fashion they are all bisexual nymphomaniacs who thrive for every man, and have non-stop sex with each other when there's no man available. Also in typical Franco-fashion, the film includes some seriously demented perversions. A guy keeps his wife on a leash in a room, and always brings her food, which he positions out of her reach in order to torture her, for example - and she actually gets sexually aroused by this treatment! Which director except for the weird mind of Jess Franco would come up with demented stuff like that? As in all Franco films, the cinematography is pretty well done.<br /><br />Overall, the film is very amusing in the beginning, mainly due to the lack of any logic, and the fact that Jess Franco obviously doesn't give a crap about it. However, it gets pretty tiresome towards the end, and the conclusion is about the most senseless thing I've ever seen. This film may be enjoyed by my fellow Franco fans, and it is recommendable to anyone who wants to see 96 minutes of boobs and weirdness disguised as Horror. If you want to watch a GOOD film by Jess Franco, stick to older productions such as "The Awful Dr. Orloff", "The Diabolical Dr. Z" or "Venus in Furs". This film may well be described as utter crap; however, I cannot deny I somehow enjoyed it. No doubt Amando De Ossorio's Blind Templars would be ashamed for their sleazy descendants.

Jesus Franco is a director who has made dozens of horror, soft-porn crossovers that all have in common that they are being really bad ones. If you ever wondered what sort of movies Ed Wood would be making, would he still be alive today, all you have to do is pick up any random Jesus Franco movie.<br /><br />By credit this movie is a remake of the 1971 Spanish horror-classic "La noche del terror ciego" but quite frankly, this movie has very little or nothing to do with that movie. Seriously, don't watch this movie expecting an horror, for this movie is more all about its nudity and lesbian fondling than about any horror. As a matter of fact there aren't even scares or graphic killings in this movie. Just a couple of hooded men standing around and occasionally, not so graphically, raping a girl.<br /><br />As always, the story is an absolute mess and very little in the movie is making sense. The way the entire movie is progressing is laughable and just very far from convincing. It has some really stupid characters in it, that you just don't ever care about. Jesus Franco doesn't seem to be able to see and fill up any gaping plot-holes, or he just simply doesn't care about it. Either way it's a bad thing.<br /><br />And yes well, then there are some of the sex sequences that literally come out of nowhere often and show absolutely nothing. I don't even think that the lovers of soft-core porn flicks are going to get excited by anything that gets shown or done in this movie.<br /><br />Again Jesus Franco uses his own wife Lina Romay in the movie as the main lead. Like all of the other girls she spends most of her time walking around naked in the movie. The girls in this movie are either being naked, having sex with each other, getting raped by a man, or talking each others head of, like a bunch of annoying, loud, naive, helpless, chicken.<br /><br />I must say though that I still enjoy watching older Franco movies better than the newer ones, that he is still making this present day and age. At least these movies still had a bit of style over them and got shot at location instead of in a studio or in the garden of one of the cast-members.<br /><br />Trademark bad Jesus Franco stuff.<br /><br />3/10

Well, first things first...<br /><br />Jess Franco tries, bless him, he really does, but unfortunately the man hasn't had an original thought in his life nor would he know an erotic scenario if it bit him in the arse! (although you can be sure if that ever does happen he'll film it & stick it in a movie!). Before anyone thinks I'm just Franco bashing, I'm not, I've now seen over 60 of his movies so think I've seen enough to have a pretty good idea of what I'm talking about, I even like some!<br /><br />For anyone not very knowledgeable about his work, the Franco process of film-making seems to go something like this:<br /><br />1) He sees someone else's film.<br /><br />2) He quickly rehashes it, adds in some god-awful ugly sex scenes, all of which takes a couple of days and hey presto, a week later the film's released!<br /><br />And that's about it. I've yet to see an erotic moment in any of his films (though the moments in this one are probably the least annoying of his I've seen) and most of the naked women he's used aren't all that attractive either (although again, to be fair the women in this movie are about the best I've seen in a Franco film), so no real reprieve there.<br /><br />Personally I prefer it when he leaves out the sex altogether, but even then (as is the case with 'Mansion of the Living Dead') he's so ham fisted in his approach that he generally ruins any element of horror there might've been.<br /><br />Having said all that, this is still one of my top 10 Franco films, which to be fair says a whole lot more about his other films than it does this one as it's at best only decidedly average!<br /><br />As a side note, on the region 1 DVD release of this Mr Franco has some very derogatory comments to be made about a certain George A. Romero which I have to say are completely out of order, not to mention contradictory (his comments about them being slow!), especially when you consider the movie Franco was rehashing here was 'Tombs of the Blind Dead' - itself a (great) movie which would never have existed had Romero not redefined the zombie, moved it into modern times and made it into what it still is today! And that's without even getting into comparing the talent of the two men, which is never going to be in Franco's favour! It basically just sounds like sour grapes, as Romero had something which still eludes Franco today - an idea!<br /><br />Shame on you Jesus!

Apparently Jess Franco didn't think that Joe D'Amato's EROTIC NIGHTS OF THE LIVING DEAD was weird and tasteless enough, so he put his own two cents' worth in...<br /><br />Four oversexed waitresses on holiday spend their vacation in the ugliest-looking hotel in screen history. They must not enjoy the surroundings any more than the audience does because they're soon amusing themselves with exhibitionism, nudity and sexual encounters with the manager and each other. The manager, meanwhile, keeps his skanky wife neck-chained to a wall with food just out of reach, in a situation copied from Franco's own BARBED WIRE DOLLS. Hold on, folks, it gets better! The hotel is next door to a monastery that served as a torture chamber during the Inquisition. Before you know it the sadistic zombie monks are back-homicidal and horny. One monk's face looks normal; most are skull-faced knock-offs of The Blind Dead; and the leader's face looks like an under-baked pizza. Several murders and two sex attacks by the undead ensueand leave it to Franco to make the rape of a busty blonde by zombie monks boring. There is a cute twist at the end if you can keep your eyes open that long.<br /><br />Like most films by this director, MANSION OF THE LIVING DEAD is best watched first thing in the morning after the caffeine has just kicked in.

I watched this movie a couple of years ago; I believe it was in Spanish with no subtitles, but that didn't really matter. What mattered was that it was fantastic! I know 95% of the world's population wouldn't agree with me, but I always had a thing for old sleaze/horror movies which seem to be made just because the director had nothing to do, had had a funny dream he wanted to realize, or that he just needed money.<br /><br />As for this film, I couldn't understand why the title had anything to do with the action. I only remember some scenes with cloaked individuals walking slowly as though in some kind of procession. And there was a man (Antonio Mayans I believe) talking often to some girls, and there were scenes of various sexual intercourse; although I found the atmosphere in the film very serious and unpretentious.<br /><br />There is one very interesting scene where a couple of girls are lying on the beach, and suddenly a meat cleaver flies through the air, thrown from a hotel window high above, and lands in the sand just beside them. I was intrigued by that scene, quite intimidating.<br /><br />Only Franco (Oasis of the zombies) and D'Amato (Porno Holocaust, Erotic nights of the living dead) could make movies with this kind of enchanting atmosphere. A solemn, sombre echo from an era since long lost, which after the forgetful ravages of time still can like the bird of Phoenix rise from the ashes of oblivion to once again let its plumage shine with unprecedented respectability.

Directed by Leslie Howard(who also played Mitchell)The First Of The Few tells his story from an idea he had one day watching the birds to the planes flying in the war.Made in 1942 a year after the Spifires helped win The Battle of Britain this is an uplifting film made I imagine for the sole purpose of building troop morale. R.J Mitchell(Leslie Howard)is a plane designer who's designs were deemed to revolutionary for the time.Along with his old friend Geoffrey Crisp(David Niven)who was a pilot in the First World War he sets out to build the plane. Geoffrey backs him up 100 percent and is the test pilot for Mitchells aircraft.However tragedy is just around the corner when (after working flat out without sleeping or eating)Mitchell feels unwell and consults a Dr who tells him if he does not stop he will die in just a year.Will Mitchell ignore the advice or heed it?well if you read about him you will know if you don't know the story then watch this wonderful film.David and Leslie have a great chemistry and play their parts well a must see film about an important part of British history.

David Niven is definitely channelling old friend Errol Flynn here, in the role of the irrepressible Geoffrey Crisp! One assumes the part was created to afford a little feminine light relief, since the central character is -- inconveniently for the standard narrative curve -- already happily married as a young man when we first meet him, and omits to look elsewhere... At any rate, Niven-as-narrator is a charming scamp, and refreshingly the plot refrains from taking the obvious path of marrying him off to his 'snapdragon', R.J.Mitchell's formidable secretary Miss Harper. The relationship between the two eventually softens in their mutual affection for Mitchell, but never becomes romantic.<br /><br />But it is Leslie Howard in the central role who undoubtedly owns the film; perhaps unsurprisingly, given that he is credited as both director and producer, but it is a typical 'quiet' performance that effortlessly overshadows Niven's endearing antics. As one bemused company director remarks after an encounter with the character's unassuming forcefulness, "But I thought you said he was *shy*..?" <br /><br />The decision to open the film with extended sequences of anti-British propaganda sourced from Britain's enemies -- from Goebbels to Lord Haw-Haw -- is a striking one, and more effective than any tendentious rhetoric on "The last Bastion of Liberty" in establishing the concept of an existential threat. The riposte is made chiefly by a montage of quintessentially English images; 'this is what we are fighting for'. And the context is set in the Battle of Britain, with an overworked handful of pilots and Spitfires flying again and again against vastly outnumbering waves of attackers.<br /><br />It is not, however, really a 'war' picture. If anything it is a biography of the Spitfire as much as of its designer, and the story effectively ends pre-war in 1938, with the commissioning of the first planes. If it has a fault, it is that I felt the film was perhaps a little didactic, an instructional piece of history rather than an emotionally engaging human drama; we witness Mitchell's career frustrations and achievements (oddly, it is never made clear just why Crisp blacked out with almost fatal results in that early seaplane competition; one would assume it was from the hitherto unexpected g-forces produced by banking at such record speeds, but the issue, subsequently a well-known fighter pilot phenomenon, is simply dropped unexplained)... but it is only at the end of the story, where Mitchell in effect deliberately sacrifices his own chances of survival in order to get the Spitfire design finished, that we are actually drawn into the tensions of the tale rather than merely observing. The enclosing narrative device is clever in that Mitchell's fate is left carefully ambiguous at the start; since neither the contemporary audience nor modern viewers are likely to be familiar with the history of this 'back-room' figure, the ultimate outcome remains 'up for grabs', as it were, and the hero's choice an active one until the end.<br /><br />Rosamund John provides effective support as loyal wife Diana, despite the absence of conflict between them to provide a cheap motor for their scenes together (particularly memorable is a scene in the kitchen where Diana has to reinforce her husband's faltering resolution to maintain his integrity at the cost of his employment... while trying to get him to chop the parsley!) Scenes in pre-war Germany are handled with a light touch that distinguishes the German pilots and designers from the politicians responsible for their deployment, and with an ironic comedy that recalls "Pimpernel Smith", Leslie Howard's earlier potent propaganda vehicle. Script writer and ubiquitous character actor Miles Malleson can be glimpsed in a typical cameo role, and David Niven, while always entertaining, shades his character towards maturity while representing a whole generation of ex-WWI flyers who found themselves cast adrift at the end of hostilities. It was the ending, with his now-middleaged RAF officer taking to the air in person and then pursuing the German pilot who had shot down one of his squadron-mates. that I found a little trite.<br /><br />But the final imagery, as the Spitfires fly away from the camera into an opening canyon of gilded cloud, is magical, aided by William Walton's soaring music.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed and would recommend the film, but felt it not to be entirely the dramatic equal of the other test-pilot picture with which I always confuse it, David Lean's 1952 "The Sound Barrier", nor of Howard's previous wartime excursion "Pimpernel Smith". It is undoubtedly a pity, however, that Leslie Howard's directorial career was cut short by enemy action; in his choice to serve his country in wartime cinema rather than pursue a Hollywood career, he proved himself to be a weapon of considerable effectiveness, and it is ironic in the context of this film that, as in the case of R.J.Mitchell, it proved to be a choice that may well have cost him his own life. As a swansong, the role is poignant but also appropriate.

Produced during WW2, I guess this film can be excused for its romanticised account of the story of the development of the Spitfire. The basic details are current: development from the Supermarine seaplanes, Mitchell dying of cancer, etc - but the development was nowhere near as smooth as depicted!<br /><br />The William Walton score (now known as the "Spitfire Prelude and Fugue") works particularly well.

The mostly decent performances from Shannen Doherty, Colm Feore, and Tamara Gorski were the best thing about this forgettable film. The dialogue is laughable and the plot is overflowing with twists and double-crosses, but it's hard to tell who's fooling who -- is the *character* bad at pretending to be loyal, or is the actor just bad at portraying the character? I can see why this one disappeared without a trace.

Propaganda, yes, but what else would one expect in wartime. On the other hand if we must have propaganda let it be as sincere and well meant as this. Though it's largely irrelevant I confess to being a little bemused by the large number of posters who think that Leslie Howard was English when he was in fact Hungarian. Having said that there is no question of his genuine feeling for his adopted country especially as manifested here in a film he directed as well as playing the leading role. David Niven offers strong support albeit more or less playing himself and Rosamund John is effective in the somewhat thankless role of Mitchell's wife. Given both the limitations of the time and the fact that it was shot on a genuine aerodrome whilst the war was in full swing the aeriel sequences are as well as can be expected. As a time-capsule it's well worth a look.

A fine movie biography about the designer of the World War II Spitfire. Strong performances are given by Mr. Howard and David Niven. Although it seems dated particularly with the black and white film, it is none the less worth your time to preview this movie. Leslie Howard was killed in an airplane crash shortly after finishing this film.

'The First of the Few' relates the story of the development of the Supermarine Spitfire by R.J.Mitchell, although as almost anyone who knows anything about the 'Battle of Britain' will tell you, around 70% of the Royal Air Force's front line fighters were Hawker Hurricanes. Slower, but a more stable and resilient gun platform than the Spitfire. In the Battle of Britain (fought in the summer of 1940) the Royal Air Force deployed the Hurricanes against bombers, while the more agile Spitfires engaged their fighter escorts. The Hurricane was designed by Sydney Camm (1893-1966) who designed many post-war jet aircraft including the Hawker Hunter - maybe someone should make a film of his life. An uncle of mine was an ace with 6 kills to his credit, flying a Hurricane from Malta. His aircraft was short down by British anti-aircraft fire on 29-12-1941. No, there's nothing new about friendly fire. William Walton's music also makes a great contribution to the film, and is now rightly (popular as the 'Spitfire Prelude and Fugue')in the concert hall.

One of my biggest loves in this world is the Spitfire fighter aeroplane. A wonder of aviation and an engineering masterpiece, its speed and versatility, (not to mention the brave boys who flew them) were the sole reason why Britain remained in the fight and fought of the foul invasion force throughout the dark days of 1940.<br /><br />Although now old and obsolete, no other aeroplane has as much right or privilege to fly over our green and pleasant land.<br /><br />Here the Spitfire is given top billing in a biopic of it's creator R.J. Mitchell.<br /><br />The great Leslie Howard plays the genius designer, in what was to be his last 'appearance' before the camera. Mitchell was an aircraft designer of noted repute having invented several of the Supermarine seaplanes which secured the Schneider Trophy for Britain throughout the 1920's and 1930's.<br /><br />He was one of the few people in Britain to have heard the snarls and threats of Nazi Germany and was an open campaigner for rearmament, a policy not at all popular with the British Government of the time. Yet despite opposition he fought against not only the bureaucrats but a serious and life-threatening illness to design and build, what has been regarded since as the greatest fighter aircraft of all time, in preparation for a war he knew was coming and a crisis the rest of Britain chose to ignore.<br /><br />David Niven plays Geoffrey Crisp, Mitchells friend and test pilot, who's affable and likable performance is hampered slightly from the fact that his character is completely fictional. Geoffrey Crisp, whoever he was, was never a Schneider trophy winner for Britain.<br /><br />The true facts for anyone interested are that H.C.Biard won the title for us in 1922, followed by S.N.Webster, H.R.D.Waghorn and J.N.Boothman in 1927, 1929 and 1931 respectively, the last three flying Mitchell's Spitfire forerunners the Supermarine S5, S6 and S6B.<br /><br />Also Geoffrey Crisp was not the test pilot of the very first Spitfire. That high honour goes to Joseph 'Mutt' Summers, who took off from Eastliegh airport on 5th March 1936. Summers became the chief test pilot for Vickers and was also the man who dropped the very first life size prototype of the bouncing bomb over Chesil Beach, Weymouth in 1943.<br /><br />This is a great movie, and one which makes all Englishmen grateful and proud, but with all historic based movie stories, there is always something that has been changed, omitted or hushed up, especially in a film made during the war at the height of it's 'keep mum' propaganda battle.<br /><br />Enjoy it like I did, but if there are any R.A.F or aviation buffs out there and would like to know more about the Spitfire and it's history, the glory of the air racing days of the 20's and 30's or just more factual information about the great man himself, then I suggest you visit www.rjmitchell-spitfire.co.uk

My father was one of the fighter pilots featured in this film (speaking part and "action " shots ) This film was part of his "war" ,if you like. To me ,this film represents the very best of British cinematography of its day and genre.I have some "stills " of the film and also quite a few w action shots (no pun intended !)on the open air set at RAF Ibsley in 1942. The soundtrack on most broadcast copies is rather poor,but the quality of the music score is beyond question.The composer ,william Walton was commissioned at the time but his music was not thought particularly noteworthy .It was not until the 1960's his music was accredited rightly in my view as a work of sheer brilliance. I agree with everything anthony Inglis has said in his commentary

'The First of the Few' shows Leslie Howard at his most reflective, almost to the point of diffidence. His only show of assertiveness is when he informs the haughty bigwigs of 'Supermarine'that he will design aeroplanes HIS way, despite David Horne's salutary warning that he will 'come an almighty cropper'. Howard plays R.J. Mitchell, legendary designer of the Spitfire, the revolutionary fighter plane that was to take centre stage in the Battle of Britain.<br /><br />Throughout the film it is Howard himself who takes centre stage and never really leaves it, his star quality and charisma embracing all manner of scenes, from cheeky one - liners, 'you're not a bird, but you can fly', as a retort to Tonie Edgar - Bruce's mercurial Lady Houston, or modestly basking in the reflected glory of yet another Schneider Trophy triumph (the annual seaplane contest between Great Britain, USA and Italy which has now passed into folklore). Perhaps he is even more compelling in the touching solo scenes, with little or no dialogue, where, to William Walton's evocative music, he is found by his colleagues overworking himself deep into the night, trying to design the Spitfire before the imminent spread of Germanic imperialism, or, later on, close to death, scanning the skies for a sign of David Niven leading the way on the famous fighter plane.<br /><br />An impressive cast of character actors give him great support, including Roland Culver as the supportive and insightful head of Supermarine, Anne Firth as a petite but highly efficient secretary, and future film maker Filippo Del Giudice as a foppish, hilarious Bertorelli, the high ranking Italian official who relays the message from 'Il duce' Mussolini, to the effect that the winning British Schneider Trophy entry could only have achieved such a feat 'in our glorious Italian sky'.<br /><br />Howard's introverted Mitchell is in contrast to David Niven's jaunty, red blooded senior pilot, who demonstrates in this film just why he will go on to be the top British star in Hollywood, his easy acting style and unbridled optimism making Crisp a lovable character without ever seeming arrogant. Perhaps his inexplicable crash in one of the Schneider Trophy contests has the effect of 'bringing him down to earth', both literally and in character.<br /><br />The only downside of the film is an oddly mechanical performance from Rosamund John, as Mitchell's wife. Obviously she could not come over as a dominant figure to Howard's subtle Mitchell, but the attempt to make her appear even more introverted than the star produces an uncharacteristically robotic outcome from this fine actress.<br /><br />Both Mitchell and Howard were soon to pass beyond earthly constraints into immortality, the latter disappearing in mysterious circumstances, ironically, in a plane, over Portugal, in June, 1943. There is no finer epitaph to both of them, than 'The First of the Few', Mitchell as the genius aeroplane designer, and Howard as the first English actor (albeit of Hungarian parents) to make it big in Hollywood. In this respect, Niven may be regarded as 'the second of the few'. A gem of a film, whose great star never shone more brightly than here.

This film could be unique in that the aircrew "extras" in the film who "Scrambled" during the Battle of Britain scenes were all pilots who had actually flown in the Battle of Britain.<br /><br />I know this because at the end of 1941 I was stationed at 61 (Spitfire) Operational Training Unit at Heston (now part of Heathrow airport) and was billeted in Meadow Way Heston. My roommate was a Flight Sergeant I Hutchinson who was on "rest" from operational flying as the Maintenance Wing test pilot and was one of the "extras" in the film.<br /><br />My recollection is that he had to be up at crack of dawn and was seldom free before about 2200 hours. On the other hand, his base was the Savoy Hotel!<br /><br />To be a Flight Sergeant in 1941 meant you had been an airman pilot for quite some time and consequently had a lot of experience. I see from the Battle of Britain Roll of Honour that, thankfully, F Sgt Hutchinson survived the war.<br /><br />He gave me my one and only flight in a single engined monoplane - a Miles Master - and I still recall that experience with great pleasure.<br /><br />FAG KAY 33 Marchmont Rd Richmond Surrey TW10 6HQ

The film was shot at Ibsley (now no longer in existence either as a base or a beacon, though you can see the remnants) which was in Hampshire, and in 1942 an active fighter station. The group of airmen listening to David Niven recounting the story of Mitchell were real RAF airmen. The filming did not stop for the war. If the bell went to scramble, filming would temporarily be halted while those airmen would run to their spitfires, go off and fight the war, before returning and carry on filming as though nothing had happened. At the end, Niven was so impressed with those heroes that he sent them off to The Savoy in London for the weekend, ringing the manager with instructions to give them whatever they wanted: women, drink, food, making sure the bill was sent direct to him. Difficult to imagine our pampered "stars" doing likewise these days! How do I know so much? One of those unsung heroes was my adored uncle Peter Howard-Williams, who had been in 19 Squadron flying out of Duxford during the Battle of Britain, but happened to be at Ibsley when the station was chosen for the film.

This is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and... I stopped caring. This is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex. There's a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment. Also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports...<br /><br />Sounds promising?<br /><br />Not really.<br /><br />I became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film. Basically I started not watching, which made events seem even more surreal when I did look up.<br /><br />It may work for you, it didn't for me.

Compared to this, Tarkovsky is a speed freak.<br /><br />Compared to this, Bela Tarr is MTV.<br /><br />Compared to this, the movie "Russian Ark" is a roller-coaster ride.<br /><br />I've just described 3 of the sllllowwwwwesssstttt experiences I've ever known, and this one tops them all. But that's not saying it's bad. On the contrary, I really liked it. But it was a chore.<br /><br />I won't describe the plot, because you can easily find that elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the plot is INSANE. It's one of the most creative and bizarre ideas since "Becoming John Malkovich". I believe the interesting plot is the main reason I kept from nodding off (also, the humour was nice. That's something we rarely see in slow, artsy films).<br /><br />Here we see a bizarre reversal of the norm. Most movies have little plot & little substance; yet they fill 90 mins with a lot of eyecatching images to keep us enthralled. But "The Hole" has 100% plot/theme without much to please the eyes. In that respect, I suppose it's a truly intellectual experience, much like reading a painfully verbose novel like Thackaray's "Vanity Fair" (which I've NEVER been able to finish!).<br /><br />If you have a tremendous attention span, I think you'll really like this film. Despite its molassessy pace, it's highly creative and imaginative. It's like Jean-Pierre Jeunet on quaaludes and with a drab, dusty camera lens. Best of luck.

i think this film was confusing and had a bad plot.Shannen did OK in this but not as well as she normally does.i found it hard to follow the whole story and found it quite boring and didn't enjoy it till bout half way but i didn't enjoy it much i would say not the best of films i have watched with her in :l what was the point of this story and what was the plot<br /><br />I've seen Shannen in better in other films i was very disappointed when i finished watching this cause it wasn't what i expected i would I've this film a bad review of 3 out of 10 Shannen is still the best actress in the world and she can act whoever put that comment that she cant she just isn't good in that 1

This film is like a dirge. UNTIL it gets to musical numbers which are like MIND F*CK, but gentler, like a mind caress. MIND FOREPLAY. The depressing vibe given from the speed & desperateness of the characters can be pretty Kill-Yourself-Awesome UNTIL you get to the musical numbers. It's a great film. Optimistic. Weird. Manic-depressive(Bipolar). That's it! THIS MOVIE IS BIPOLAR. anyway see it. IT'S A MUSICAL!!! WITH DEPTH!!!! If you like the existential dross like The Stranger, or Waiting for Godot, Then your probably get a real kick out of this one. I had to get the DVD through Amazon.com for like 12$. OH & the songs rock. well they rock but they aren't rock, there like calypso, jazz, Broadway, but by Grace Chung, & I can't find the soundtrack NOWHERE< but i wanna the songs are great, & the dances are so fun.

The whole world is falling prey to a lethal disease, and rain never stops pouring down : nevertheless, in this atmosphere of nightmare, a man and a woman discover that they are neighbors, thanks to a hole in the floor of the man's apartment. They fall in love : at least, all would not have been lost. Although this wonderful film expresses the loneliness and the weakness of human being, there is also some room for hope, in the shiny singing scenes.

In the middle of The Hole I e-mailed a friend of mine to summarize it. Not sure if the film would break down into a series of submissive gestures, I felt a little un-easy recommending it, but then I saw the ending. It's perfect. I've been living in Korea for 6 months, and this film could just as easily summarize the strange ennui and frustration of any Asian metropolis as it takes on Taiwin here. It uses the myth of Hong Kong musicals the same way Godard or Hartley use Western musicals, but takes it to an extreme, it's gritty world and occasionally Kafka-esquire logic make it all the better. I really feel like The Hole's closest comparison is Hal Hartley's Surviving Desire, but have a kinda bleak edge to what are ultimately hopefully and strangely metaphorical films. Anyway, this is what I wrote to Esther. Hope you like The Hole too.<br /><br />Hey,<br /><br />watching a move called the hole. Taiwanese I think seems a bit to weird for china unless it's hong Kong. it's worth seeing so far. it's about a guy and a girl in an apartment complex. the guy's ceiling caves in and the girl starts to get annoyed and well it's kinda a weird metaphor for the simultaneous pleasure ,degregation, and pain of a rather intense crush. there's also a kinda zombie-virus-sub-plot too and a lot of weird little scenes where the girl acts out her desires through rather innocent and kinda fun 50's doo-wop sequences. worth a look.

This movie, one of the best I've ever seen, talks about incommunicability. It does it plunging ourselves in a livid Taipei, stained in cold colors, where the rain falls incessantly; a DAMP world. It does it displaying us the story of two persons living in this world, a man and a woman. a coincidence, or the fate,links their existences, but they're not able to open one to the other with words. Characters are the mirror of the difficulty of our society concerning interpersonal relationships. An incommunicability that here is taken to the extreme limits. all the characters exchange only a few words during the movie, dialogues are nearly absent, and when some words are spoken they're often weak and empty, far away from describing people's real feelings. So, the progression of the story, the revelation of character's feelings is developed (brilliant idea!) by the musical digressions, only apparently meaningless, that speckle the movie. The proceeding of the sentimental event, and the drama of female protagonist, lead us to a splendid ending, heavily symbolic. A movie totally different from the usual, a clever realization by a great-talented director. PS. Forgive me for my bad grammar!!

It's less visceral than the only other Tsai film I've seen ("Vive L'amour"), but the idea of doorways (holes) into others' emotions and existences is vividly portrayed here, as Tsai sets up long shot after long shot, usually with long takes, suggesting a sense of alienation in Taipei. The musical interludes, inspired by Grace Chang, are perplexing but welcome mile-markers that add new dimensions to the slowly evolving relationship between the young man upstairs and the woman downstairs. It's not necessarily an easy film to watch (although it's not heavy-handed by any means), so I'd warn any casual viewers who are looking for some "indie" entertainment (like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie). But if you'd like to know something about isolation among city-dwellers in Taiwan, and something more universal about city alienation and romantic yearning, then watch this film immediately.

(the description of the mood of the movie may be considered as a spoiler - because there is not much action in fact)<br /><br />Great one...<br /><br />Is it for my peculiar interest for the dystopias and utopias? Is it for the atmosphere of the movie. Or is there some more magic? If yes, it is for sure the utmost human one...<br /><br />This film is, no doubt, extremely artistic/artificial (depends on taste). I can imagine most of the people who hate to watch slow movies (and those of Tsai Ming Liang (who I didn't enjoy other times) are one of the slowest that I know), suffering during the movie. Yes, people are unable to slow down and to let time pass - and to watch it without feeling they waste it. One can take this piece as torture or as a therapy...<br /><br />The topic at the surface? The lack of communication - even if we live in rabbit cages - one next to each other - but not really together? People are tired, sick of something and unable to describe it - just don't want to meet, touch, talk, confront the others... like if they had disappeared. The big block of flats looks void and the rain falling constantly evokes the strange melancholy inside. And sometimes it must be something abnormal, unexpected, some unwanted decay as a hole in the floor of concrete - that allows us to reach each other.<br /><br />One of the possible ways to look at it is this: Don't survey the inner world of the characters - consider the whole movie-space to be inside of yourself. And ask - why is it there? Where could these depressive states and moods come form? Is there a place for them, they don't have a right to be here? And search for the answers (if you need them) among the walls and halls of the block - instead of inside hardly transparent mind of a man.<br /><br />The key to understand is not-to-understand - to let a movie borrow us - as a subject of study - inside itself - and at the end safely return us to our more colorful and "normal" looking reality.<br /><br />Then, maybe, you will reach - like me - the feeling of real, possible, non-pathetic hope, that in core we are still humans... and this state of mind can help one much to live in this world.

*MINOR SPOILERS*<br /><br />Need any further proof that Tsai Ming-liang ranks among the most original and provocative filmmakers working anywhere today? See this film.<br /><br />Working from slight variations of a theme running through most of his work, THE HOLE represents a study in alienation and loneliness - in this case between a man and woman who are upstairs/downstairs neighbors - and how varied structures (real or psychological) of modernity wall people off from one another. Here, the woman (the downstairs neighbor) attempts to endure as her apartment is flooded by a prodigious leak from upstairs. A plumber attempts to locate the source of the problem, then disappears after creating a large hole in the floor. Already isolated and desperate (both characters are among the few residents of a housing project who haven't fled in advance of a mysterious, near-apocalyptic epidemic). The hole linking the two apartments functions first as yet another in a long line of indignities, but soon begins to take on a significance of near-mythic proportions.<br /><br />Tsai's sense of humor, and sense of cinematic history is displayed with a bit more overtness than usual - as the woman's occasional daydreams revolving around her upstairs neighbor are visualized as musical numbers (set to the music of Grace Chang) which explode from the screen in brief bits of sensualistic, surreal romance and humor - quite reminiscent of the big-screen PENNIES FROM HEAVEN. And for all of the ennui and alienation on display here, Tsai's skewering of late 90s pre-millennial tensions is funny, absurd, and gives this film a very appealing strageness. The final scene is extraordinary.<br /><br />Meanwhile Tsai - in typical fashion - subverts most of the usual expectations or preconceptions Westerners bring to Asian cinema with a nonchalant, casually-revealed directness, focusing on both the absurdist tendencies of the human mind, and the most absolute of mundanities. There's an utter, nonchalant demystification of almost everything about his characters, sidestepping backstory or most cultural signifiers (which does amplify the isolation of the characters), making THE HOLE - and his other films - rather disorienting, but also always fascinating and insightful.

In the final days of the year 1999, most everyone in Taiwan has died. A strange plague has ravished the island. Supposedly spread by cockroaches, the disease sends its victims into a psychosis where they act like the insects. Eventually, they die. The Hole takes place in a crumbling apartment building (which is especially well created; kudos to the set designer!). Its two protagonists live right above and below each other. The woman is on the lower floor, and the pipes above her apartment are leaking fiercely, threatening to destroy her food supply, not to mention her sanity. She calls a plumber to go check it out, and he accidentally pokes a hole through the floor of the man's apartment. The two have never met before, and they come into contact through the hole.<br /><br />The script is quite brilliant. Few films are simultaneously this funny while remaining completely human, deeply exploring the human condition, especially feelings of loneliness and despair. Tsai's direction is simply beautiful. Like a lot of other Taiwanese directors, he uses a lot of long takes. But unlike, say, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai doesn't overuse them. In fact, I don't know if I've ever seen them used better. They're always effective and never tedious. <br /><br />It would be wrong to review this film without mentioning the musical numbers. Yes, The Hole is also a musical, and a great one, at that. In the film's best scenes - which is saying something, considering how good all the other scenes are - the man imagines that the woman is a singer, almost a cabaret singer. These numbers are fully choreographed, often with backup dancers and singers. In a stroke of genius, Tsai has these elaborately produced numbers take place in the crumbling building, the signs of apocalypse and decay unhidden. This provides both a sense of pathos and absurdity.<br /><br />The Hole is a film that begs to be seen. It ought to be a cult classic, if nothing else. Before I went to see this, I was told that it was a decent film, but probably Tsai Ming-liang's least good one. Well, if that is true, I just cannot wait to see another one! 10/10.

It's unbelievable how silly some movies can be. I forgot completely why it was that I started watching this movie. It has a story, I'm sure of that, but it can't have been a very thick one. Everybody seems to have motivations, but they don't say anything about them. They just look pondering into the camera for a moment or two (three, ten) and then take action. A little more light on the flyers activities would in other ways also have been nice. I mean: they're on a spaceship, the electricity bill will not be the largest post. And that way it is actually possible to see what is happening to some of the flyers, fights in the dark do so little to me.<br /><br />By far the worst film I've ever seen.

OK, so this movie isn't all that fantastic. Having been a LONG time fan of George R. R. Martin, and having literally cried real tears at the ending of this short story, I was a little disappointed in the way this was converted from story to movie. The many changes made no sense to me at all, and as is usual in a situation like this, the movie ends up being nearly terrible. Still, it has many redeeming features, including the To Die For gorgeous Michael Praed, the always fun Catherine Mary Stuart (playing what was a black amazon woman in the book as a rather uninteresting white girl - can't blame HER for that). It's really not the casts fault that the script was mangled. Even the crazy Michael Des Barres is great, but I would have rather seen the oh-so-cool pocket void-head explosion brought on by the blood-pressure-increasing psychic drug scene, over the silly cuts-off-half-his-head-and-he-keeps-on-fighting nonsense this movie had.<br /><br />The whole thing with Royd's "mother" was badly handled - in the book, she was sinister and creepy, terrifying and powerful, here she's kinda creepy and somehow pathetic, instead of tragic and still sympathetic as she is in the book.<br /><br />The book is MUCH better - all of Martin's short stories are just awesome - and I have to admit, I envisioned Michael Praed when I read Royd Eris's adventure, and that probably helped bring on the tears when it reached the end. The movie's ending is, in the sense that it didn't make me cry, better, but the tragedy that was Royd Eris's life in the book is really the better quality ending.<br /><br />Like Sandkings, the TV version takes out all the fun parts, dumbs down the smart parts, and assumes we can't deal with the complications and ideas as presented by Martin in the originals.<br /><br />Shame on whoever made the changes, you could have kept the same cast, and not changed the story any, and it would have been a MUCH better movie. All in all, it's not a bad sci fi romp, but don't expect much. Read the book after you see it, and you'll be amazed.

Really intriguing story, I sat glued to the TV. Good, smart twist at the end makes the movie even better then expected. The surprise element is great. Shannen is a great actress who plays the part flawlessly. Great acting combined with good story, a ten.

The silly, uninteresting story (a computer that has the mind of a mother with a fixation on her son?) and the annoying overacting of some of the players are the two most important - but not the only - problems with this very, very minor sci-fi flick. However, the effects are good for what they probably cost, and Catherine Mary Stewart shows indications of being a strong female lead - she deserves a better movie. (*1/2)

Why the heck are high-tech spacecraft so misty in the interior!? Apparently, the humidity controls on the ship's air conditioning system were set up to maximum; either that or the filmmakers were trying to rip off Alien. Other than the spectre of mist, the action and the acting was pretty lacking and even grinded down to a halt at times. From the laser beam shooting out the side of the gun (bad, bad editing) to the cornball scenes of the headless, decapitated body choking someone, this movie is filled with flaws, but the worst flaw was the awful mist which seems to condense on my television.

Is it just me, or is this movie basically "Event Horizon"? It makes me wonder if Paul Anderson saw this movie as a kid and then subconsciously recreated it later. A crew of expendable caricatures head for deep space in a mysterious and uniquely experimental vessel which is secretly both sentient and malicious. The evil spaceship begins to throw spooky vibes and lethal accidents at them in equal measure, and a guy who is very "in tune" with the bodiless lurking evil gradually becomes obsessed and consumed by it, eventually graduating into a full-blown zombie possessee. He is killed in a messy, disfiguring way and yet because he is the ship's puppet/mascot he comes back again and again. Eventually what's left of the hardy crew manages to circumvent the "evil core" of the ship and explosions ensue. Does any of this sound familiar? It makes me wonder if EVERY contemporary genre film has its own obscure eighties counterpart that nobody remembers.<br /><br />-H

This sci-fi/horror film is very unusual.I really don't want to spoil it but it has a slow beginning and middle but the climax is a long intense ending!If you haven't seen this movie before than give it a chance,it'll be a different experience for the sci-fi and horror film fan!

I need to comment on this movie since reading all of the other comments and knowing how many times I've seen this movie...I should say something. First, I read the book after I saw the movie and was surprised by the different direction the movie took. Most of the names were changed, some of the characters themselves were totally different that described in the novella. Having seen the movie before reading the book, however, I thought it was an interesting story. Getting past the sets, editing, script and continuity issues, I saw interesting character study and flow of events. At least we got a little glimpse of some of the character's pasts, if we listened closely to some of the sometimes rambling conversation, and saw briefly into their personal lives...especially Royd Erris and Jon Winderman. When I look at the movie, I try to get into the meat of it ...as if it was really happening at that moment. What were they thinking, experiencing. What kind of emotional bond was going on between some of the characters. However, after I read the book, I thought the movie could have been so much better. I gave the movie an 8 out of 10 for a great attempt at creating the mood of the characters and atmosphere of the Nightflyer described in George R.R. Martin's awesome short story. I found the book at an old used bookstore 600 miles form my house. I believe you can get in online. Read it!

When saying that because FSL, GSL, and ASL appear the same so they must be similar, is like saying because you can speak French, German, or English it is all similar, as you know isn't the case. Believe it or not, they are very much different and there is no such thing as universal signs. Although there are a few signs that are similar, just like we say "NO" and in Spanish the word for our no is in fact, "NO". But really, a Deaf person who signs ASL would have a VERY hard time communicating with someone who signs GSL. Sorry to be giving you an educational piece, but you wrote it so I had to comment it and I didn't want you to look bad to the Deaf Community. Thanks, have a great day!!!

The story was beautiful and provoked deep emotions in many sections, but I felt that much of the talent was aimed at displaying the ordinary communication within the family rather than the love of music or whatever passion the main characters may have had for their chosen lives. I felt cheated in some respects because the music and jobs seemed more window-dressing that life choices. Seeing and hearing Giora Feldman was a surprise and a treat. I wish there had been more about the music or more about the parents and their internal lives.

Beyond Silence is a beautiful film that you never forget. Her beautiful scenes and her story make an excellent movie. Her director,Caroline Link,make a sence film about life and love.Her music is wonderfull,including the Klezmer music with the actress,Sylvie Testud,touched in a scene.The rest of actors have a perfect performance.Presented in Mar del Plata Film Festival in 1997,the movie is one of the best pictures of this decade in Argentina. My opinion:The best german film of every times.Please,don´t forget see.Is an order.

As a German myself I know how bad usually German movies are. This one is one of the very very very few exceptions. What makes it an exception is: no overdoing morality, no sentimentality beyond realism, GOOD ACTORS (all of them newcomers, so nepotism didn't do it as in many other German movies), an original story. Is there a scent of dawn in German Filmindustry ?

Definitely a rare and wonderful find for a movie which includes a cast of REAL (instead of hired hearing-actor-pretending-as-a-deaf-person actors that you see sometimes in films!) deaf actors in the movie world nowadays.... <br /><br />Also, it's a bigger plus when you consider the directional approach chosen for this film -- it's an appreciative success.

I did not know what to expect when I watched this movie but I can tell you it left me guessing from the beginning to the ending, and the ending was what threw me so , this movie was well done for a made for TV movie. The story line kept you wondering who was actually involved and Shannen Doherty was great. She has so much talent and did such a good job in this movie. She brought believability to the role and dept to the character. She proved that no matter how her past is constantly being thrown back at her she has an incredible talent and puts more than one hundred percent into what she does. She proves that she can move on with her work.

Contrary to previous comments, sign language is NOT the same around the world. It is true that American Sign Language and French Sign Language are quite similar; this is because one of the first teachers of the deaf in the United States was a Frenchman, Laurent Clerc. However, at the the present time, French and American Sign Languages only have about 50% lexical similarity. Additionally, although German Sign Language is somewhat similar to other European sign languages, it is not related to ASL at all.<br /><br />The sign language used by the little girl in this movie is German Sign Language. Her father is played by an American deaf man and her mother is played by a French deaf woman; their signing in German Sign Language is understandably accented.<br /><br />For the record, I am a certified interpreter in American Sign Language.

I think this is a very neatly made movie. Although the focus of the movie itself is on Lara, the audience is also able to get to know each character's personality (e.g. Lara's parents, and her aunt and uncle). I personally found the reconciliation scene of Lara's Father and his sister very touching (though a bit too quick).<br /><br />This movie encourages people to go and search for their own ideals and ambitions, and at the same time let them know that despite every kind of fame and riches in the world, nothing can be more important and precious than the love from your own family. Very touching indeed.<br /><br />The music used in this movie is breath-taking as well. Alas that it doesn't have a soundtrack (or does it?).

Jenseits der Stille (Beyond Silence) is an excellent film. I wish I had seen (or heard about) this film years ago! I am a big fan of German cinema and have worked closely with the Deaf community in Canada. The performances were outstanding and the story realistic. I hope to see more works by these actors, the writer and director.<br /><br />Chad

i first saw this movie over 5 years ago when i was working at walt Disney world. after i first saw it i walked out of the theater in wonder... and the comments that i heard from others that saw it - they thought that it was just as good as i did!<br /><br />coming from a background in Deaf education i can tell you that German sign language and asl are not the same. they are similar however... enough for me to know most of what was being said after watching the movie for a while.<br /><br />i lived at a deaf school for a year and so to see the relationships between lara and her parents... well, let me tell you that was done quite nicely. and i just love the scene with tom and lara and the song 'i will survive'!! it made me laugh so hard!!!<br /><br />for a while after i saw the movie i looked to buy it. i could not find it anywhere for quite some time. i finally found it available online and bought it on VHS. yes, there is a soundtrack, as i have that as well.

I am a high school German teacher and my kids absolutely love watching this movie! They always ask to watch it over and over when I can't be there and they have to have a sub.<br /><br />I have learned some A.S.L. and can say that there are similarities but A.S.L. and German Sign Language are definitely different! I can appreciate the struggles Lara goes through and she does a good job, for her, at trying to balance in all 3 worlds. Deaf, Hearing and Music. It's only when outside factors cause tension that spill over into one or more of her worlds that she has trouble coping! There is that one sad moment in the film that gets me every time, something I can relate to but, overall, the entire film is captivating and leaves you wanting to know what happens with Lara, her career and her relationship with her family and Tom afterward! I'll never tire of this film!

Entertaining film about a young girl whose parents are mute and depend upon her to communicate to the speaking world for them. Her aunt, a free-spirited musician, teaches her to play the clarinet, but the parents object. The young girl matures into a young woman whose musical abilities and desires become paramount. Her dependent parents attempt to keep her home and away from her chosen vocation. Well acted and a good drama. Large, yellow subtitles.

I recently rented the movie, "Beyond the Silence," and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />As a sign language interpreter, I have read many books about CODA's (Children of Deaf Adults). I think that "Beyond the Silence" does a pretty good job of showing the difficulty and extra responsibilities that a child with deaf parents experiences.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this movie, I would suggest reading the book "At a Loss for Words." It's a very touching story about a girl growing up with deaf parents and coming to terms with her feeling of guilt and anger and also love for them.<br /><br />I'm not trying to be "preachy," but PLEASE don't call deaf people "mute." That term is negative and out-of-date.

Young Lara is in a most unusual situation: her parents are both deaf-mute, so she has to communicate for both of them. It's sort of a constraining situation, and when a relative gives Lara the chance to become a musician, her parents try to keep her at home. She will have to choose.<br /><br />The idea of the daughter having to speak for her parents is not something that I ever would have thought about, but "Jenseits der Stille" (called "Beyond Silence" in English) made me think about it. It's always good to be able to see such intellectual stories, especially when Hollywood makes so many pointless blow-'em-up movies.

"Beyond Silence" is a tender look at the rift which develops between a young girl and her deaf parents as she and her interest in the clarinet grow. The film delivers it's story with a soft touch, avoiding extremes while maintaining an earnest sense of legitimacy. Excepting a few minor glitches, the film is technically and artistically well done, the acting good, the directing superb, and the story warm and thoughtful. A worthwhile watch.

One person asked whether German Sign Language is the same as American Sign Language, and, knowing just a bit of ASL, I can tell you that it appears to be the same. (French SL is almost identical, and I presume it's similar throughout the western countries.)<br /><br />As for the movie, it's one of the best I've seen. Two things I especially liked about it: 1. The story is totally individual, and it isn't part of any genre -- it's just a real-people story. (I remember thinking this about "Fearless" as well.) 2. The story is so well written around the main character, Lara -- she herself has many facets to her personality, but no other character sees all of them. Each person understands and evokes only one side of her. This creates conflicts within the character, which the actresses do a great job of expressing.<br /><br />What a terrific movie.

Remove yourself from the Kirk Douglass aspects of the casting. It is essential to your enjoying the film. There is a beautiful young woman playing double roles - and in the photos from the 1800's, I can't believe how smooth and white her skin is. Also, there is an excellent degrading of the film stock which chills the mind if you like faded greys and yellows as I do. This film is played on TNT from time to time so see it.

I think this is a GREAT film, and a wonderful piece of artwork. A very touching story between Lara and her parents. By the end I was weeping I was so touched ( and I don't cry easily at movies ). The Deaf culture is one very few of us take time to understand, but I think through films we can at least try. I HIGHLY recommend this film to anyone who is interested in Deaf culture, or just a great foreign film.

German films are like a tombola.You pull a lottery ticket and mostly its waste money. But sometimes you have luck and your ticket is the jackpot. Caroline Link,the director,from Bad Nauheim,my home town,is with Tom Tykwer and Hans-Christian Schmid the only hope for the german film. It was her first film for the cinema and then it was nominated for the golden globe. Its a wonderful film. You can love,hate,dream,cry and laugh. The protagonists are all very believeable. Mrs.Link doesn t need any special effects or optical drumbaborium to tell her story. One newspaper wrote,as good as candle-light,and thats the perfect description of the film. And I want to add,as soft as snow-flakes.

I was lucky enough to get to see this movie in a German lesson in school. Basically right from the start I was caught up in it and knew, that this would be something different. The mood of the movie simply progressed with ease and gentleness, and at the same time hurled you into a world many never would have thought of. The world of a normal young girl, who has to go through an unusual dilemma, because both of her parents are deaf, and at the same time face the difficulties of life, experiencing her own true self. Finding herself turns out to be one of the real challenges in her life, because she has to separate herself from her parents and walk down her own path, without turning her back on them. She wants to be a musician, an idea which her father does not understand or support. Becoming a musician, despite the fact that her parents are deaf, gives a very clear and pure image, of how children tend to disobey their parents and create their own identity. The movie ends without really wrapping up every lose end, but it does not spoil it. Nonetheless it gives the movie the perfect ending, in which everything that really matters, works out. The idea of the movie and the very story has, as I have mentioned, a very deep and original plot, but this movies has more to it than this. Great acting (especially from the father), great music and is overall greatly directed and written. Good movie with many details. 7/10

As the child of a single parent who is deaf, Beyond Silence is, in most aspects, a very true portrait of how I grew up. Scenes such as going to the bank and talking to the teacher were my actual experiences and difficulties I have faced all the time. It was just so real I couldn't help getting emotional as the story went on. For those who live or work with deaf or hard-of-hearing people, this is a must see; for those who don't, you should definitely see it as well and cherish your good sense of hearing -- being able to communicate easily is not a gift for everyone as most people take for granted.

This show was bad ass! It would've been so AWESOME if they could've been on TV for more than two seasons. The parts of season 3 that I've seen were even better than the first two (on average). Cripes, there was so many funny things on that show, I miss it big time. I just about loved every character, but especially Sifl, Chester and Stealth. It's great how they had guests on like the devil, God, his arch angel (let me give a shout-out to all my ARCH ANGELS IN THE HOUSE!!!) Michael, Earth, Mars, the Sun, and jeez a whole lot more I can't think of now. When Chester beat Grout on Trivia Trapazoids I just about crapped my pants. "Why? Why?" Of all the songs they did, my favorite was when Olly just got back from Seattle and did that bad-ass punk song about how "HIS SO-CALLED LIFE IS JUST LAIM!!!" ROCK!!! That show rocked.

This show is so great. Shows like this only come once in a blue moon, and sadly, most American viewers don't get the wacky brilliance. This was one of the last MTV shows I was happy to see. There were so many great segments, most notably precious Roy and calls from the public. I also really enjoyed the main characters' totally inane conversations. It was hilarious in such an absurd way. So many of my friends I went to high school with also loved this show. It's too damn bad a show like this didn't get picked up by Comedy Central or Adult Swim, because those channels were better at dealing with more out of the box shows. It's surprising that no other shows have tried to do something like this, considering how little money it would cost to make

Loose Change is a documentary created by three college students. The documentary looks to answer a very important question... what happened on 9/11? Their theories? Let's take a look: <br /><br />1) The U.S. government planned and orchestrated the attacks on its own soil, causing the deaths of more than 3000 innocent people. To try to prove that the government is capable of such a thing, they make a reference to a fake terrorist attack, which was to be carried out in Cuba in the 1960s. The only catch is, nobody in that "attack" was supposed to be injured. I fail to see what this has to do with 9/11. Now, I'm not a big fan of the U.S. government. Matter of fact, I cannot stand it, along with Bush. But to actually suggest that they would be able to carry out such a horrible act, both morally and tactically, AND keep it a secret is ludicrous! <br /><br />2) The Pentagon wasn't hit by flight 77... it was hit by a cruise missile. They try to prove this by saying that there is a lack of plane parts, and the parts that are there are not from a 757. Brilliant! I don't know how they missed the mountains of debris sitting on the lawn of the Pentagon. And anyone with half a brain could figure out that if a plane hit a building, it would leave a hole, not a cookie-cutter outline of an airplane like in a cartoon.<br /><br />3) The WTC towers collapsed because they were rigged with explosives, and it was a planned implosion. Again, brilliant. They also say that the plane "barely hit" tower 2. That really got me angry. The plane flew into it at 500+ knots. If it was a planned implosion, how, oh wise college students, could they rig both of the ENTIRE buildings without anyone noticing? <br /><br />4) Flight 93 didn't crash. It landed safe and sound in Cleveland, Ohio, and the passengers somehow magically disappeared. The phone calls from the planes were all faked. It is "impossible" to make cell phone calls from that altitude. All I can say is, how do these people sleep at night? How on earth do they have the audacity to make such an outrageous claim! <br /><br />5) The attacks had nothing to do with Osama bin Laden because, get this, he said so! He said he had nothing to do with it. So the creators disregard the mountains of evidence that proves what really happened on 9/11 and they take Osama's word as it were sacred. Why don't you just spit on the victims' graves? <br /><br />Loose Change is a documentary filled with half-truths, speculation, quotes taken out of context, poor research, logical fallacies, distorted facts, and testimonials from other conspiracy theorists. The research done by these guys was very poor. Not ONCE do they even attempt to actually contact a real expert, because that would disprove their theories right away. The so-called experts that they use are themselves conspiracy theorists. All of the news sources quoted in the film are from right after the attacks. As a matter of fact, I don't think there is a single news article quoted that was from after 2001. A lot of times, the creators are dishonest. And what really gets my blood boiling is that these guys take their opinions and theories and state them as fact! Unbelievable.<br /><br />You should always question everything before believing it, and that includes garbage like this. Throughout the whole thing, I don't think they prove a single point. I don't think they even have one. Loose Change is misleading and dishonest at best, and downright offensive at worst.<br /><br />Recommended reading: http://www.loosechangeguide.com/LooseChangeGuide.html

I saw this movie and then I read the Popular Mechanic's debunking. I also watched the debates on TV featuring the producers of Loose Change and various skeptics.<br /><br />Without going into how emotionally charged these young men are (which is a funny thing for me to say because I'm only 25 myself), I was constantly annoyed by how they liked to repeat 'it just doesn't add up'.<br /><br />In my opinion, conspiracy theorist start off with an advantage, because while the adherents to the official version of events must PROVE their claims, the conspiracy theorists don't - they succeed when they manage to create enough doubt about the official version of events.<br /><br />I agree that there are some questionable areas in the official version of events.<br /><br />However, the alternative simply does not add up.<br /><br />Here are the reasons why the conspiracy theory (that the US government planned and carried out 9/11) does not add up.<br /><br />1. Why would the US government blow up the third building ('building 7') with bombs, hours after the attack? Why would they do this on purpose? Wouldn't doing so raise questions in everyone's minds??? <br /><br />2.Why would the US government fire a cruise missile into the Pentagon, and then say it was attacked by a passenger plane? Why would they risk being found out? Why not use a real plane (passenger plane or otherwise) and drive it into the pentagon, so that there is no danger of people raising questions about the lack of identifiable remnants of the plane at the crash site? <br /><br />3. Why would the US government crash 2 passenger planes into the WTC, and also blow up the buildings with bombs planted at various floors? Why risk being found out? Why not just blow up the WTC with bombs in the first place (with no planes crashing into them), and then claim it was a terrorist attack (of which they have proof)??? <br /><br />4. The official version claims that the planes were hijacked by terrorists, and that they crashed them into the WTC. But if the conspiracy theorists are correct, then who flew those planes into the WTC? Religious extremists are well known to strap bombs to their chests for suicide bombing, but are we to believe that somebody was prepared to die for the economic benefits of the USA??? If they were driven by an autopilot (as some people claim), then how can you explain the frantic phone calls of the passengers to their families??? <br /><br />They say truth is stranger than fiction. Sure it is strange that the 'building 7' collapsed, but just because you do not fully understand something, it doesn't mean it cannot happen.<br /><br />In summary, I think that the theories put forward by Loose Change have at least 10x the number of inconsistencies that the official version has.<br /><br />Now you'll probably claim that I am really a CIA agent who is typing this from some unknown location, under direction from some unknown branch of government.<br /><br />OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH... creepy.........

...as MOST of the very very unjustified and critical reviews about Loose Change SE are from people who only wrote ONE comment on IMDb; to tell us that this movie is rubbish because it's facts are wrong.<br /><br />Yeah, right.<br /><br />I liked this movie because someone has to dare to produce such stuff. It is highly entertaining as well. And it will make us rethink about what we behold as true. Which is very important because most people are eating what the American Media is giving them to eat: Bu**Sh**<br /><br />And no matter what the truth is, it is not the official report and that is a fact for sakes. We are the people and the government needs its people like it needs the government. But it is the people to be supposed to have the power, not the government. Go to some courses of constitutional law, you might learn something about the philosophical background of a State, its territory and its population.

i saw this on Youtube and thought it was very interesting. Basically, its a documentary. A documentary on what people believe what really happened on 9/11 was a government conspiracy. now, being skeptical of the government is one thing, and it's good to be skeptical, it shows you're a human being with a mind and that your mind is smart enough to actually do research before you believe the truth. unfortunately for all 3 Loose Change movies, there a TON of facts they got wrong. (for more information, see "Screw Loose Change" on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkh0Mx3bLDU ) writing this comment, people probably think i'm a guy getting paid to type this. well no, i'm not, i promise you that.<br /><br />Loose Change was made by Dylan Avery, a twenty something year old guy with a weird voice. now i give him credit, because he actually made a decent screenplay, if only he got more of his facts right. Loose Change for the most part is pretty boring, with some unnecessary info and a few non-resourced quotes.<br /><br />viewing this documentary, it depends on what you think. if you believe that the government had something to do with 9/11, then you might find it pretty true. but if you think it's bologna, and you want to check for actual facts like me, then you'll find it has a lot of mistakes in it, which is BIG when it comes to an even like 9/11.<br /><br />2 out of 10, because i liked some of the music

it is a quite slow pace face-to-face Brynner/Douglas...i found there was some pretty heavy violence/gore but you know, seventies giallo style : (maybe some spoiler ahead) a little bit phony and fake but the image is there : the monkey torn apart, the flesh torn from the mechanic, etc...<br /><br />i don't remember if it is alike the novel...but overall i think it is a OK action flick, hero flick : he stands all alone at the end, all the bad guys are out..........<br /><br />and nice images too : a small rocky island, the sun over the sea<br /><br />but not a typical Verne's story-on-cinema : subs, sci-fi; but the adventure seen in a lot of Verne's novels tough

As an evenings entertainment this film is intriguing viewing, as a valid look at what happened on 911 this film flounders in a mire of its own making.<br /><br />The point of the film is that something other than the official story occurred on 911. According to this film the planes that hit the World Trade Center were not the planes we were told, that a missile hit the Pentagon, flight 93 was shot down, that some or all of the planes were off loaded and the people may still be alive, the collapse of the twin towers was the work of demolition not the crashes, and that there is some grand conspiracy behind it all.<br /><br />Its an intriguing idea, or series of them. The problem is that not a great deal of it really hangs together, at least not in the way that is presented here. Could it be possible? yes, but not with what we are given as evidence.<br /><br />There is little real expert testimony. We only get snippets from other sources. No real expert in any field is interviewed. (which is important when it comes to construction of the Twin Towers since they were unlike any other building that they are compared to when they talk about fires in steel buildings) We are only given statements, usually one line from someone, we don't know anything about other than a title, about things they may or may not know about.<br /><br />Every person who saw anything is accorded equal weight (a woman who appears to be watching events from Brooklyn or lower Manhattan, far from the towers, is heard to say that the plane crashing into the tower isn't American so therefore its not American.) Everyone is seen to be telling the truth at all times. A miss quote of President Bush is seen as proof of something other than as a mistake. The filmmakers also take every news report as gospel truth with a report of the blowing up of one of the towers roofs being portrayed as true when the footage shows its not There is no room for any error in any news footage, its not an error but signs of the conspiracy.<br /><br />The evidence in one sequence of pictures is forgotten when discussing another so that the evidence of the planes that hit the towers being commercial airlines from some shots is dismissed because its not clear in others. (also the phone report of one eyewitness that is contradicted by photographic evidence is given a great deal of weight) And at times the film throws things out-like the off loading of passengers, but gives no evidence as to why this may have happened or what happened to the people. You can't make claims if you don't back them up. Likewise unexplained is talk of a conspiracy that it has no shred of evidence as to who or what is behind it. You need to tell me more than just "they are behind it". Tell me who "They" are It really annoys me because as long as you don't think about what the film is saying or the inconsistent stories its spinning this is a really well done piece of film making. Frankly I could almost believe its stories, except that none of them make any real sense when you stop to think about them.<br /><br />Worth a look, with a large grain of salt, simply because it lays out the alleged conspiracy many people feel is real. Fortunately or unfortunately it fails to make its case because its evidence is severely lacking.

People that disagree with this film use words like 'lies' and phrases like 'conspiracy theorists' to describe it. One even claims that this film disrespects the victims of 911! On the contrary, I believe it's those that go with the status quo and believe everything they hear in the news and everything their politicians tell them is the gospel truth, that disrespect the memory of the dead! I am not saying that this film has it all right. More questions are asked than answered, but on the whole, I believe the point of this film is to get you thinking and talking with an open mind. It asks a lot of the viewer. It's almost uncomfortable to watch because most of the points covered leave you with a reasonable doubt with regards to the official version of the events of 911. There is more to the story of 911 than we have been told, this film should leave you wanting to learn more about the truth, as long as you have an open mind and are not averse to having your preconceived ideas challenged!

I know what people are thinking, another documentary based on conspiracy theories, but just for one minute ask yourselves, why are there so many of these films (documentaries) barking up the same tree?, maybe, just maybe there's some fact in what is being told. Also remember most if not all of these films are made by Americans not by outsiders and as a result of the attacks on the Twin Towers 100,000 Iraqis' have perished, and now in Britain the US and majority of the world the war is being called illegal but we cry for the 179 soldiers (UK) that have died out there fighting for their country but not for one minute do we realise the chaos and death we have caused. <br /><br />Watch it with an open mind and question it but if you have already come to a conclusion that this film is a farce then avoid it and God help you.

What defines a conspiracy theorist (CT)<br /><br />1) Believes any weird theory blindly, as long as it goes against all logic and reason. 2) Is a virgin. 3) Is willing to lie and manipulate as much as possible as much as possible to convince/convert people to their believes. <br /><br />But that aside, this is an awful film - yes it is not a documentary, i think it is fiction.<br /><br />Do you CT's (Conspiracy theorists) really believe that Dylan Avery have uncovered the "truth", by digging trough old government records, websites and archive footage to expose this? The man is a college student or dropout - he has no experience in the world (but then again neither do you CT's).<br /><br />Do you really think it is possible that Dylan Avery have exposed that the white house have cynical killed 3000 people 9/11?? And that the white house somehow let Dylan Avery do this documentary? The answer is no. If all what is in this "documentary" is correct, then we can assume that the government is "all powerful" and "all knowing". We can assume that the government have no moral problems with killing thousands of innocent people. The government are according to all CT's cynical mass-murders, who kills people without second thought. And yet Dylan Avery was allowed to live and make his "documentaries" that could bring down the whole government-system, and he has also been allowed to make a second and now even a third version of his film (he keeps updating them, because he has to replace his exposed his old lies and disproved facts with new lies and facts). The point is that he is allowed to live proves that all the conspiracy theories are lies.<br /><br />The thing about conspiracy theories is that they are not scientific in nature, they are political and psychological of nature. People want to see a big conspiracy theory behind it all. They want Americans to be responsible. Because according to their prejudges Arabs and Muslims aren't clever enough or angry enough to do such a thing - only Americans. Conspiracy theorists wants some American conspiracy to be responsible for everything ad that has ever happened in human history. <br /><br />The fact is that there are evil men in the American government, as well as in every single government in the world, and in every religion. They have to be evil, to combat evil, and to do good in the end. <br /><br />Every man or woman who cant see that there is an undying hate towards the USA is an idiot. Of course Al-Quada exists, and of course they planned 9/11 and executed it - even though you conspiracy theorists wants it to be Americans.<br /><br />I have known many Muslims, and in many of them, the hate exist - so move out of your grand-mothers basement, conspiracy theorists, see the world, and you will know that evil does not only exist in USA - it is all around us all. <br /><br />Conspiracy theorists: do you actually think that the US-Government planned all this, and then somehow got the thousands of FBI-agents, fire-fighters, demolition-experts, scientists, CIA, rescue-workers, NSA, airline pilots, Police, the house of representatives, high-level military contractors, air-traffic controllers and the whole Bush-administration to keep this big secret?? Do you actually believe that?

I've seen this awful trash 1 time. If you weren't clever, you would easily be taken in by the lies of this movie.<br /><br />The way so many people believe in this movie, without doing research themselves, really highlights how dictators like Adolf Hitler came into power.<br /><br />Funny thing though: the people that hate this movie all have much text to explain why this movie is flawed and full of lies. While the conspiracy theorists who love this movie, only have a few lines to say about the movie - nothing concrete. Really highlights both kind of peoples intelligence. A typical comment from The conspiracy theorists could be: "Me love, is good, against Bush, Against America, against Jew, bla bla bla". While the comments from people that hate sound like this: "This movie is flawed, because of these facts etc.". Also most of the conspiracy theorists who have commented this movie, only have commented this movie. Which makes me suspect that most of all the users that love this movie, is just one person, who wants to up-vote his favorite movie.<br /><br />But this is not a documentary, it is a political movie, with something that sounds like facts.<br /><br />But all the lies of this movie have been debunked, thankfully. www.911myths.com

This so-called "documentary", tries to "document" that George Bush and CIA planned 9/11, and that no Muslim would or could ever blow himself up in a suicide-attack (though they do everyday in Iraq).<br /><br />The documentary is SO full of flaws and direct lies, that the creators of this "documentary" have even admitted it. But they don't care if there is evidence or not, as long as CIA and Bush did it. <br /><br />The whole notion is paranoid and Americanistic - I.E. the idea that everything, good and bad, is caused only by USA, and that the rest of the world doesn't matter or doesn't exist.<br /><br />It is a retarded Conspiracy theory. It is total Paranoia. I hate when paranoia somehow gets viewed as fact. When speculation gets turned into fact. I am a conspiracy-basher. Ever since i saw a conspiracy-Mockumentary, by a french director, named "Operation Lune". TV told it was fact. As an idiot i believed it blindly: because it is was on TV. Then years later i found out that it was a fake documentary, to highlight how easy it is to make people believe any conspiracy with a documentary with made-up facts. And at that point i knew how Hitler had made his lies into fiction. I knew the horrible power of the Conspiracy theorists. And i knew that i had to fight it. Because if Conspriacy theories are not challenged at every given moment, then they turn into fact for most people.

This poorly made documentary tries to convince people that CIA somehow planned 9/11, because they wanted a war on terror. At first it sounds like a fantastic plan for a fictional movie, but people actually believes in it - almost like a religion.<br /><br />Since its release, all the facts have been disputed, and even the creators of this "documentary" admits that it is full of flaws. But they don't care if they have evidence of their claims or not, as long as USA is responsible for 9/11, then they are happy. <br /><br />But why don't any of these conspiracy theorists think for just 1 minute? If the CIA planned 9/11, to make the war on terror, then the Arabs must have been patsies. But then why was the Arabs from Saudi Arabia???? If the CIA and American Government is so powerful as the Conspiracy Theorists claim, then they made the Arabs come to America to be in the Planes. But then why from Saudi Arabia, if USA after-wards waged war against Afghanistan and Iraq?? If the CIA was so powerful as the conspiracy theorists claim, then they would made Iraqies and Afghans go into those planes, because then they would have a greater argument to attack the Arab-countries in the so-called war on terror, especially Iraq.<br /><br />The problem is that it is not a concern of the conspiracy theorists. Because it is religion to them. They WANT the Americans to be responsible for every major event in history. They want to see CIA pulling the strings. <br /><br />The typical Conspiracy theorists, when working on a conspiracy theory, starts with the conclusion, and then works from there, choosing the evidence that can fit the theory and discarding and ignoring all facts and evidence that contradicts the overall theory.<br /><br />Also all the facts of this film have been debunked: www.911myths.com<br /><br />The worst part of the film is when Dylan Avery claims that the families of the victims of United 93 didn't talk to the passengers on the plane. No, Avery claims that they talked to CIA-agents, who used voice-reconstruction-technology, to make it seem that there where a struggle on the plane. The technology in question is just a new technology, that CANT be used live, it has to be used on a recording, and even then it is not 100 % accurate. Also different people have different way of speaking, not only accents and voice, but also how they react, humor, way of talking and so on, which technology cant imitate. Also if they copied their voices, then they must have had all these many passengers, all of them mind you, under surveillance for months. And also many of the people that where on the plane didn't even decide to board the plane until few days before. You conspiracy theorists aren't using your mind.<br /><br />And then think of how complex this plan is: monitoring hundreds of people, making sure that none of the thousands of pilots, airport-personal, CIA, NSA, FBI, Policemen, firemen and citizens didn't talk. Making sure this voice-reconstruction-technology worked. Killing all the people on United 93, by many military-men, who had no moral problems with it. Don't you get it? If just one of these factors didn't work, then the whole operation fell?? And people would know the truth. Which heavily implies that there WAS NO CONSPIRACY.

Wake up people.<br /><br />Governments the world over don't care about you. They are run by human beings just like you. Some of you steal paper clips from work or enjoy sneaky perks.<br /><br />People with lots of power steal bigger things and commit more serious crimes.<br /><br />Let go of your misplaced respect for human beings in charge.<br /><br />They are not even in charge of themselves.<br /><br />Loose Change asks questions that few people want to know about.<br /><br />Funny how when tough questions are asked, dumb people come out with sledge hammers.<br /><br />These are only questions...little questions...but the people who don't want to know arm themselves to the teeth and viciously refute them all.<br /><br />They are subconsciously afraid of their inability to think.<br /><br />They love other people speaking for them.<br /><br />Humans hey. Strooth.<br /><br />Don't get angry when your government is questioned. Your government who is so powerful, but who let a gang of 'terrorists' infiltrate and kill thousands.<br /><br />See, there ain't nothing good about the government. Governments suck.<br /><br />Every military person, every politician, every analyst, every aide, every national security person should have resigned in disgrace after 911. Why are they still all there? You can almost see them getting fatter off the carcasses of the people they helped kill.<br /><br />These are evil narcissistic human beings.<br /><br />Why weren't they all sacked for gross incompetence? How do they sleep at night? There might be no bigfoot, no aliens, no JFK hit, no Loch Ness monster, no boogie man, no ghosts, no sixth sense, no magic, no god, no devil, no nothing....<br /><br />but there is the 911 lie.<br /><br />A terrorist's passport survived the horrific explosion and landed onto the street where an FBI agent was on the scene to bag it? Now come on!! The greatest minds in the field of steal structures use the term 'pancake theory' to explain the collapses? Spare me! Anyway, just keep flying that flag, salute your first in command, cook your sausages and enjoy the country that was peacefully inhabited by the soulful Indians many years ago.<br /><br />You are scum. White Europeans and their machinery and undustrialisation and their dollar value on everything has set the tone for the sad, sad state of affairs.<br /><br />But, hey, we are human beings. We are territorial. Dumb like apes. We guard our territory, we fight, we steal, we kill. We are dirty apes.<br /><br />But we also think.<br /><br />I think the official 911 story is rubbish.<br /><br />I think 99% of the population of the western world are primitive scum.<br /><br />I think Loose Change is melodramatic. It's one of many documentaries that uses stupid atmospheric music to aid its message.<br /><br />Like a shot gun, it misses a lot of the target...but some of the shot is on the mark...and those are the bits that hurt the people who believe the official story hook line and sinker.

Many people did not question what they were told by the Media and the Government, regarding the terrible events on September 11th 2001 (911). The official story was just accepted with out question in all the chaos and terrible loss of life that day. Now, clearer heads have prevailed, and further investigation by noted and highly trained professionals, scientists, and academics, and many concerned people, has raised serious questions as too what we were told, as to what really happened that fateful day on September 11th 2001. It is now very evident, from research, investigation, and peer review, that the official story is not only wrong; but that nefarious actions by Israel and the United States Government were at the center of the September 11th 2001 events, which had been planned for months in advance. Now a group of people, called the Truth Seekers, have been systematically and diligently looking into the facts of September 11th 2001, and as a result, have, and are, exposing large numbers of false information about this event, and exposing the real Truth behind September 11th 2001. What the real Truth is, has yet been fully exposed or agreed on; but it is now very clear that what America and the World was told about the events of September 11th 2001 are not only not True at all, but has a sinister twist to it that involves secret involvement of Israel and the United States Government in a preplanned plot to stage this event for nefarious purposes and for political manipulation of the American People, and the World. This documentary is hard hitting, and raises serious concerns and questions as to the Truth of the events of September 11th 2001. Every American should see this documentary, as should Citizens Globally. America and the World were deceived in one of the most nefarious events in modern history. Learn the Real Truth behind this most diabolical and evil event of modern human history. Now learn the TRUTH, and see this great Documentary. You will be very glad you did!

Though it's now been 24 years since I saw it, I still remember thinking that I should have walked out of the theater.. No one in the audience laughed even once. The only one laughing was the person who took our money for the tickets.

This film has provoked such discussion amongst all of you, just read the comments, that i'm quite impressed. Those of you who blame it on conspiracy theory, are being single minded. I do not believe that the film is totally correct; actually, a lot of it is probably wrong. But only a small bit of correct evidence is not good enough. They have no conclusive evidence, but this helps their case to some extent. If the video tapes from the nearby buildings were just released straight away, then there would be no controversy, as they could have blown the Pentagon attack as a missile out of the water. But it wasn't. Isn't that just slightly strange? If the FDR was uncovered and released to the press, then it would blow their theory out of the water. But it wasn't found. How does a building, which nowadays are constructed so very carefully, free fall due to a fire in the upper segments. I'm not a great physicist, but there's something wrong here. Buildings just don't free fall, seriously. These are some of the more interesting discussion points, and i feel that they really ought to be discussed. One final fact that they have right, is that the Bush government did benefit from the attack. In favour of the sceptics, bombs could have been planted by terrorists, (I do think bombs were planted and went off, buildings don't free fall) and we all know at the moment that a bomb is one of the terrorists greatest weapons.<br /><br />I was disappointed that they took an opinion at the end, as one of the pros of the film was that it just gave evidence, perhaps slightly biased, and no accusations. I liked the film, because it obviously took a long time to put together, and there is an element of mystery. Except the soundtrack, which was corny and unnecessary.

Jules Verne wrote about 80 novels as well as plays and short stories in his career. He began writing in 1854 with a short story called "Master Zacharias, or the Clockmaker's Soul". It was the first time he talked of the negative side of progress - the evil that results from some discoveries or inventions when they fall into the wrong hands. This becomes a running theme in his novels: Captain Nemo in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, or Robur (from ROBUR THE CONQUEROR and it's sequel, THE MASTER OF THE WORLD) are two of his best examples of this them. Kongre, in THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, is another.<br /><br />Verne was so prolific that when he died in 1905 he left a dozen unpublished novels and stories that were not fully published until 1910. They include some of his best writing, such as THE BARSAC MISSION (partly written by Verne's son Michael), THE SURVIVORS OF THE "JONATHAN", THE PURSUIT OF THE METEOR, THE DANUBE PILOT. All of these dealt with science, but also dealt with political systems, and economics, for Verne was interested in all the problems facing modern man. THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD was the last novel that was published in Verne's lifetime. It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him, but seems to go back to his potboiler period, when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication. But nothing Verne wrote is without interest. Rereading THE LIGHTHOUSE one sees what the subtle point is in it. It is the study of how the ego of a villain can prevent him from escaping retribution.<br /><br />Kongre (renamed Jonathan Kongre) is one of the last pirates in the world of 1900. He and his gang find a damaged boat and repair it. They sail it across the Pacific, and reach Staten Island, a small island in the Straits of Magellan controlled by Chile. There they find a lighthouse with a crew of three men. They manage to kill two of them, but the third one (named Vasquez - he's from Chile, remember), hides on the island. Kongre and his men decide that they should prepare to leave the island shortly, before the Chilean Naval relief boat returns in three months to pick up the lighthouse crew. But first they will wreck any boat that comes to the passage, and increase their ill-gotten gains. But the key to the novel (and it is not in the movie) is that Kongre's right hand men (Carcante and Vargas) keep urging him to pack up his supplies and wealth and head to Asia where the money can be divvied up and everyone separate in safety. And each time Kongre won't do it. <br /><br />Initially it is pure greed. He wrecks a boat, and massacres the crew (a scene that is done in the film). The sole survivor is an American, John Davis (the name became Denton in the film, except that it was given to the character of Vasquez). Now with an ally (and not a drunken one, as in the film), Vasquez starts sabotaging Kongre's activities on the island. Carcante keeps suggesting leaving, but Kongre (unused to someone annoying him successfully) keeps delaying in order to catch Vasquez and Davis. The end result is that when he thinks he has them cornered, the Chilean boat appears to sink his craft, kill most of his crew, and confront him. Kongre commits suicide to avoid capture.<br /><br />Much of the mayhem of the movie (with Denton picking off crew members one at a time) is not in the book. Nor is there any female character in the novel (a rarity in most of Verne's stories - he could be quite a feminist when he wished). The egotism of "Jonathan" Kongre is well shown by Yul Brynner's performance, but the subtlety of that trait is lost. The writers presumably did not think the audience could appreciate it. Kirk Douglas does well enough as Denton, but his singlehanded success (Vasquez and Davis work together well to the end of the story, unlike Denton's ally who is killed by the pirates) seems unlikely. The bestiality of the pirates is well shown in the movie, particularly a singularly tall actor who in one scene wears women's clothing to particularly unsettling effect. The film is not a bad minor adventure film, but it could have been better if they had stuck to Verne's theme.

To say this movie is useless isn't quite right. I can think of one purpose: tell your friends to watch it and have them tell you what they think. If they come back and tell you "Wow, this was amazing; it opened up my eyes; the gov't did 9/11", then your friends are either A) idiots, or B) dishonest... in either case, this movie is an incredibly effective tool to let you know who not to bother hanging around.<br /><br />Boy oh boy... factual error after factual error... outright lie after outright lie... pissing on grave after grave of 9/11 victim... The fact that this horse feces is sweeping the nation's college campuses completely makes me lose any faith in higher education and proves to me only that far too many college kids prefer spooky techno music to silly boring things like research and the desire to find reality.<br /><br />So yeah, other than that handy little intelligence test, Loose Change is completely useless. Read Mark Roberts's Viewer Guide; it blows to hell every single point LC tries to make and calls them on every single error. http://www.loosechangeguide.com/LooseChangeGuide.html

The government's official version of 19 hijackers with boxcutters is totally unacceptable. No investigative expert can simply dismiss the blatant exclusion of critical evidence throughout the "9/11 Commission Report". These important omissions are listed in an intensely well-researched report titled - "The 9/11 Commission Report: A 571-Page Lie", by Dr. David Ray Griffin. It's available online for anyone to read through. The 9/11 commission report doesn't even mention WTC 7. Hello? Was the mysterious collapse of that building not a part of the investigation? Also, how about the fact that 6 of the hijackers have been found alive. These kids may be wrong about some of their conclusions on what actually happened, but that doesn't make the government's official version of events any more credible. At least these guys are still asking the questions that have been left unanswered. We need a new investigation NOW!

"Loose Change" is a thought-provoking little documentary that draws attention to and questions the "official" story of what really happened on 9/11. It takes a couple of free-thinking college kids to put together such a video, since the media gets paid to divert our attention from real facts with inane terrorist warnings, "muscle" hijacker tales, bogus pancake theories and other heroic schlock. The events which unfolded on 9/11 were indeed, well-coordinated, well thought-out, planned years in advance and executed with (just enough to fool the average dummy) military precision, by not by Osama Bin Laden or Saddam Hussein, that's for sure. Complete with knife-toting hijackers, pulverized airplanes, collapsing skyscrapers and brave firemen, Hitchcock couldn't have crafted a better script. You've seen Wag the Dog, haven't you? <br /><br />See, there are actually people who believe in a 'New World Order' in which the USA is the omnipotent world power. All the Neo-cons do their part to contribute. The Bushes have at least eight years (Clinton's run) to plan their 'New Pearl Harbor' event, of which the first and biggest hurdle is getting their boy into office. With the election fixed, the Patsie in place, the biggest hurdle is overcome. Of course this time Cheney and Rummy have to pull ALL the strings cause, unlike his daddy, Dubya has the IQ of a hockey puck. Once he's elected, they waste no time in carrying out 9/11, "The Big Wedding."<br /><br />Neo-clan member Giuliani makes his pal Silverstein an offer he can't refuse - sacrifice two asbestos-riddled, low rent behemoths in exchange for millions in insurance money, and a bonus to be determined later (when Rudy becomes President?) A Bush cousin just happens to be in charge of security for the entire WTC complex, offering uninhibited access (you WILL want to read more about this.) Quite the coincidence! Schedule war games to confuse NORAD, have agents at the ready to confiscate evidence immediately following the attacks, cart away the thousands of pounds of steel as quickly as possible from ground zero and ship it overseas before it can be examined, publish photos of all 19 hijackers within days of the event, reinforcing hatred of the 'enemy' before it's even determined who the culprits are. It's genius, really, until Silverstein slips and admits they "pulled" WTC #7 on purpose. Whoops! And I doubt if one of those neo-Nazis realized that using so much Thermate would leave molten steel burning in pools at the foundations of the buildings for weeks. What fire ever gets hotter AFTER millions of gallons of water are poured on it? D'oh! <br /><br />A 757 crashed in an open field. There were no dead bodies found, no luggage, no seats, no wire harnesses, no wing sections, no tail sections, no nothing. Photographers weren't allowed near the shallow pit. (See realistic plane crash debris in "War of the Worlds.") There were no Arabic names on the passenger lists of any of those planes. How were they identified so quickly if they all died and their names were not on the manifests? Hmmm.<br /><br />Subsequently, we have been put in fear of our lives by Osama Bin Laden and other "terrorists" from "The Axis of Evil" who hate our freedom and may strike again at any time. Yeah, right. The anthrax scare that immediately followed 9/11 was just one more trumped up plan to scare the population even further and intimidate law makers into voting for a policy the republicans needed to push their NWO. There were no mysterious middle eastern men mailing anthrax to democrats! Turns out, the anthrax came from a US government lab. <br /><br />Just look at each detail and you will find that it was absolutely planned by the government, with no other logical explanation. It's not surprising that so many of you think "Loose Change" is bull. The government banks on the fact that most people are simpletons who believe everything they read in the paper and take whatever the president spews in his press conferences as gospel truth. Hah! Really, the one and only Conspiracy Theory here is the one published by the 9/11 Commission. I think Barbara Honegger said it best, "Only a military aircraft would have given off the 'friendly' signal needed to disable the Pentagon's anti-aircraft missile batteries as it approached the building. Only the military, not al Qaeda, had the ability to break all of its Standard Operating Procedures to paralyze its own emergency response system" on 9/11.

I was watching this movie and had to look up why it is totally false.<br /><br />The author answered it on his web site - "It was that month that I began writing "Loose Change," a fictional story about my friends and I discovering that September 11th was not a terrorist attack, but rather, an attack by their own government." Seems they went along and just kept increasing the fiction level. If love fiction, you will love Loose Change.<br /><br />If you want truth avoid this movie! If you use the internet to find information, you will have to sort out the 98 percent junk you find before you can find rational thought on 9/11, yet you will find all this movie's information for free.<br /><br />This is the movie, if you like conspiracy and do not want facts and real evidence to clutter your thoughts or help you make conclusions. This is the movie to satisfy the most discerning tin foil hat viewer there is, or ever will be. Relax and let someone else do your thinking.<br /><br />You know when your parents told you not to trust anyone? These are the guys they were talking about.

Most of these 9/11-Conspiracy Theorists think that USA, Jews or India planned 9/11, to blame it on the Muslims - do harm Islam, or to start a "war on Terror" (to get more power and oil). What a great idea.... for a movie. Because it would be a great plan, if it could be executed without anyone knowing. <br /><br />9/11 happened, and the conspiracy theories was there - from the start. Many conspiracy theorists believed that USA or others planned 9/11, even though they had not examined the subject - it was their prejudge, that USA or Jews are behind every bad thing happening in human history, from the biblical-flood, to the plague in the middle-ages to finally 9/11. <br /><br />The thing is that conspiracy theories WANTS Jews or USA to be the one responsible - and they fit one-sided facts and witness-testimony into their theory. <br /><br />The problem with conspiracy theories is that they are not scientific of nature - but political. <br /><br />Conspiracy theorists, when they are making their conspiracy theory, starts with the conclusion and then works his or her way from there. What ever fact nearly fits the theory are made to fit, no matter how much they have to manipulate. <br /><br />Conspiracy theorists would never exist if they wanted to listen to people, beyond themselves. Conspiracy theorists only believe in them selves, or kindred spirits, they are like religious fanatics. They don't want to listen to other people. <br /><br />These 9/11-Conspiracy Theories all have logical explanations. If only the Conspiracy theorists had the brains or will to do their own research, and listen to other people. There is a logical explanation for all the 9/11-Conspiracy theories. Just look here: 911myths.com But I know that 9/11-Conspiracy theorists will never look at the site, only because they want to keep their prejudges that Americans or Jews are behind every evil act in the history of the world, including 9/11.<br /><br />About 9/11: <br /><br />If USA planned 9/11, then why haven't a single person from the Police, Fire fighters, NSA-, FBI, CIA, Military, Air-traffic-control-people, most of the house of representatives, demolition-experts, Scientists, rescue-workers and the whole Bush-administration squealed and told the world about the largest mass-murder in modern American History? Why haven't someone revealed this great secret? Because an attack of that magnitude, on its own soil, would involve thousands of the governments own people, and these conspiracy theorists tell us that all these thousands of people had no ethical-problems with keeping the secret of this mass-murder.... Conspiracy theorists live in a fantasy-world.<br /><br />USA did not plan 9/11, all logic and reason speaks against it.<br /><br />Also, if the USA planned it, then why did they use 19 men from Saudi-Arabia??? Would it not be more clever to use 19 Iraqies, Iranians, Afghans or maybe even North-Koreans as patsies??? If people from Iraq would had been in the airplanes 9/11, then the "war on terror" would have been more easy to justify. And if this USA-Shadow-Government planned 9/11, then they would not have used 19 Saudies.<br /><br />USA, Jews or India did NOT plan 9/11, get over your childhood-fantasies conspiracy-theorists!<br /><br />Sane people, please click onto this site, it will answer all questions about the 9/11-conspiracy theories:<br /><br />911myths.com

And I don't mean about the movie. I mean about what happened on 9 -11- 01. I didn't have to be the brightest person on earth to note that the towers felt unexpectedly fast and soon, too perfect. To note that there were none airplanes remains on the ground where the tragedy occurred, both at the pentagon and Flight 93 crash site. This guys are trying to compiled all these questions many of us have, researching on dark and fuzzy ground and trying to make some sense out of it. They are not making everything up. They have people, testimonies, graphic material... and I can't say thats the true, but I can say that neither is what the media, controlled by the government has been feeding us from that day. So, I say give it a chance, see it. Then you decide what to believe.

This is a well done and entertaining film/documentary. <br /><br />Whether you believe every single word said on it, or you don't at all. You wont get bored, since this a very interesting presentation of another point of view of the events of 9/11. Maybe some very specific facts can be wrong, but that doesn't means this movie is not worth watching. I would recommend this film, since you can watch it for free from different sources through the internet. <br /><br />I am amazed by number of Reviews rating this movie with 1, that I actually consider the possibility of people being paid to rate it that way. Eg. Look How most of the negative reviews are twice or three times longer than the positive ones...

This documentary contains many factual errors and instances of flawed reasoning. The director did a poor job of finding credible witnesses and he plays on the paranoia many people have of the government. To a conspiracy theorist, nothing ever happens randomly. There is always someones behind the scenes pulling the strings. I think the funniest (and perhaps pathetic) moment of loose change is when it shows footage of the second plane hitting the second tower. The footage clearly shows the plane making a direct hit, almost a bullseye into the tower, but the narrator claims "it barely hit the tower" And the director expects me not to believe my own eyes? By the way, the narrator's smug voice gets pretty annoying. A film called screw loose change debunks practically every point made in loose change and rather convincingly. it points out the glaring errors made by this hack.

This movie made me very very angry, and not because of what it implies. But because so many people are actually swallowing this hogwash hook line and sinker. How can anyone possibly believe this crap when i would take you 15 minutes and an internet connection to find out that more or less every single claim is simply not true.<br /><br />The people behind this mess simply don't have a clue. They seem to have made no actual research of their own. They have just put together a number of other peoples "research" without even the slightest attempt to even check if the facts are correct. If they had, they would have known that Flight 77 had Rolls Royce engines and the wreckage shown in the film DOES match the engines of Flight 77. Or maybe they do know and are just lying about it.<br /><br />And this is certainly not the only time the film makes false claims about evidence presented on screen. They also fail to mention that not a single structural engineer supports the idea that there were bombs in the buildings. <br /><br />Other things such as the gold under the WTC and the faked phonecalls are just ridiculous and makes me wonder what they were smoking while making this film.<br /><br />And as usual with these stupid conspiracy theories, they fail to present any coherent theory of what really happened, they simply line up a number of lies and imagined anomalies in the official version and claim that this is evidence the government did it.<br /><br />But I wont go into detail about all the errors and lies in this film, other websites that have done that already. The stupid message aside, even the technical aspects are not that impressive, the graphics are pretty ugly, the music dull and even the speaker voice gets pretty annoying after a while.

I was at first intrigued by this documentary. Then I researched the subject, from both pro- and anti-conspiracy sites. I found out that this "documentary" is a manipulative lie.<br /><br />The "documentary" is only a compilation of old government plans and reports (taken out of historical and logically context), a bunch of witness-accounts taken out of context, a lot of half-truths, a lot of quotes taken out of context, a lot of "experts"-inteviews (which are mostly experts in fields which has NOTHING to do with explosions, air-planes or buildings), a lot of poorly pictures of questionable origin and a no understanding of science. This, with a X-files-kind-of-soundtrack, tries to manipulate the weak mind, to believe in Dylan Avery's Jason Bermas' political crusade against reason, logic and the established society.<br /><br />One of the lies made in this "documentary" is that you could not make cell-phone-calls from an air-plane in 2001 in cruising-altitude. Because he claims that the people on flight 93, weren't alive at this point, that they had been killed, and that their voices were faked. THAT IS A LIE. I ask a good friend, who travelled a lot back then (Buisness). He confirmed to me that he could and did 2000 speak in his cell-phone on the air-plane - he called his wife, who was giving birth. You could speak in air-planes back then, the problem was that the calls was cut-off, when the plane went away from a transmitter on the ground. It has not occurred for the director, Dylan Avery, that signals also can work vertical, not only horizontally. Plus: most of the calls made from flight 93, were made on air-line phones, not cell-phones. Everybody who had just half a brain, could research this for one self. This is just another example of the manipulative lies, which this "documentary" consist of. People: please do your own research, point out all these conspiracy theorists mistakes - most of them don't have an education, and if they do it is never technical. <br /><br />Another lie Dylan Avery says in this "documentary", is that the government used live-voice-morphing-technology to fake the voices of the victims on flight 93. That is simply yet another manipulative lie from Dylan Avery. A voice-morphing-technology does exist, yes, BUT IT IS NOT THAT ADVANCED YET. You cant use it live. It can be used for recorded voices, but not live, as Dylan Avery so arrogantly claims. Plus you have to have many recordings of the original voices, and then calibrate the equipment to do morph voices. <br /><br />So if you think about it, then the government would have to have tail all the passengers of flight 93 for several months before 9/11, if you take Dylan Avery's word. The government would have had to have track all these passengers for months, and they would have had to control the will of all of these passengers, to make them take an air-plane 9/11. Because the government should have a recording of the voice to make a "live"-morph of it, so they must have tailed them for months, because they could not have relied on recording enough of their voice in the airport. <br /><br />And Dylan Avery claims that these supposedly CIA-agents used this voice-morph-technology to call the families of the passengers of flight 93, and then sounded so convincing, talking just like them, using the words they use, accents and favourite-curse-words and all, and then convinced all the families of the passengers of flight 93? <br /><br />If you try to do this yourself, think about how to do it, then you'll see how impossible it is. <br /><br />So if you take Dylan Avery's word, you will see how retarded his theory really is. Either he is incredible dumb or just a liar.<br /><br />Dylan Avery has no idea on how reality works - he lives in a fantasy-world of fairy-dragons and conspiracies. <br /><br />But we should not be so troubled by Dylan. He uses poor sources. Most of the sources are taken from the day of the attack - 9/11/01. Right back when no one knew anything of what was going on. I can remember 9/11 my self; no one in the media knew anything. The journalists had reports that about 20 planes had been captured, then 8 planes. Also we heard from the media that there was 20.000 people in the building at the time of the collapse, or at least it was speculated within the first 24 after 9/11. There was simply mass-confusion. A lot of information came to the air, which did not happen/was not true. And that is what this "documentary" is build around - misinformation and misunderstandings. Most other sources that Dylan Avery use in this "documentary", have been taken from anti-semitic and anti-American sources. Not very reliable. Because these web-sites and other sources has a political agenda to discredit USA, Jews and Israel. They do this with misinformation and exaggerations. <br /><br />The only thing positive I can say about this "documentary" is that it is slightly better than Alex Jones' poor trash of documentaries. <br /><br />If you do want to watch this poorly made "documentary", do yourself a favour: research all "facts" presented in this film, so that you will not be mislead into believing that some evil-force is controlling everything. If you do not hold your head cool during this film, then you will be taken in by the lies of this documentaries. <br /><br />Joseph Goebbels once said: "If you tell a lie, which is sufficiently big and keep repeating it, then people will at believe it is the truth in the end". That can also be said about this "documentary" and most conspiracy theories.

Surprising that Jules Verne would write such a story. Even more surprising that Hollywood would produce it. Yul Brynner is unbelievably good as a man freed of all bounds of convention, free to indulge his taste for cruelty and domination. Douglass is an excellent counterpoint, a courageous individual who's chosen simple solitude as a way to deal with the complications and turmoil society had imposed on him. And Samantha Egger's character is the capper, a woman willing to sacrifice far too much for comfort and safety. Inotherwords, everyman. The movie does show its age and is limited by the conventions of time and place and technology of the time. If you're looking for special effects and action as substitutes for thought, look elsewhere.

Video and film allow vast numbers of our citizenry to gather around our intentions while discovering the best or worst of our nation. The possibility of conspiracy on 9/11 is one of those ideas that will continue to incite more and more discussion as time goes by. So much of the 9/11 Truth movement makes total and logical sense. Many of those ideas are certainly in error. But, many are not. As with any disputed historical event, there will be those who deny any truth to a new theory, especially one as foreboding as this one, and those who will believe in conspiracy, no matter the evidence to the contrary. For those who watch "Loose Change" with an open mind," I suggest going to: www.911scholarsfortruth.org for a detailed and evolving discussion of the alternate possibilities. Videos such as "Loose Change" cannot cover the entire subject, nor will it ultimately force the government to conduct a totally unbiased and complete investigation (most of the evidence at ground zero has been destroyed anyway). As usual, only time and sincere scholarly legwork may eventually reveal to us to what really happened that day. For now, however, those of us who find grave gaps in the official investigation must continue to question the intent of a government that desperately needed a "Pearl Harbor" level excuse to once again invade the Middle East. Whether this disturbing video contains truth or not, it should be considered amid all the other explanations by anyone who seeks a personal truth amid the mountains of data now available on the internet. To question the official version of this event IS a patriotic act. To allow your government the luxury of unquestioning loyalty is to allow those in power the luxury of corruption. This was not the intent of our founders.

Obviously, EVERYTHING should be taken loosely, especially when it comes to events as sensitive as 9/11 -- but I am shocked at how many people are choosing to not even question one ounce of what happened that particular day. It's exactly why America is in the state it's in -- no one wants to "rock the boat" or see another point of view, even if it means effecting an event that forever rocked our security as a nation.<br /><br />I am further shocked that the people who are so quick to disregard even an ounce of this information haven't even bothered to research "the lies" even a little. If even 1/3 of what is said in the movie is true, isn't that enough to further investigate?

The point here is not about if the this film proved anything or if there really is a conspiracy. I think what the filmmakers were trying to say is that why all the concealed evidence? If the gov't has got nothing to hide then why can't we see all the evidence that we the American public has a right to. So, I have to say it is very respectable of them to dedicate this film in memory of those perished in 9-11 because, the victims out of everyone has the right to know what really happened and to be honest the gov't haven't shown us everything.<br /><br />I can't say everything in this film made sense but at least, some of it is very convincing. This film has raised a lot of good questions. The American public has a right to know every answer to every question that this film has raised. Like why the small explosions in the Twin Towers after the planes have hit? I'd say that is pretty suspicious. Also, where are the bodies of the passengers for the other two planes? Why can't we hear the evidence from the black boxes on the planes? I'm not saying there is any conspiracy here but I think we have a right to know.<br /><br />For those of you who's seen Farenhite 911. I'd say these two films could be linked together. If you knew what the Bush family has invested in the middle east then you know that is a big enough motivation for them to kill anyone in this world. That's why the old Bush went to war in the middle east and then the young Bush went to war in the middle east. No other president in US history has gone to war in the middle east. Why? Use your brains people. Where does all of Bush's money come from? Not from US tax payers thats for sure. Their money comes from the Saudi Royal Family who just happens to be good friends with Bin Laden. Where does Dick Cheaney's money come from? His money comes from his company that invests in communications of the troops in the middle east and home. Every time there's a war his stocks go up. People kill for money. It's plain and simple. We see it everyday in the news around us. For those of you that don't believe someone in our gov't with power won't kill for money. Then I'd say you need get out of your fairytale world and wake up. If you can make a billion dollars and you need to kill 3000 people in order to do it and you had the power to cover it up and no one would ever find out it's you until your dead would you do it? I'd say a lot of people would. Those of you that say you wouldn't because you never had that kind of power. Power is corruption. Wake up people.<br /><br />Last but not least for those of you who is dissing this film I bet you don't know anyone that has died because of 9-11 and you don't have a son fighting in Iraq. Because if you do you wouldn't be so quick to dismiss this film. You would use your mind and heart and question if all this is worth my loved ones to die for. Is this all worth something? Just ask yourself that question.

I can only say that this movie is the result of horrendous research. Even though Dylan, Jason and Korey claim that they have spent 3 years researching 9/11, they still got a lot of facts wrong:<br /><br />1. AA Flight 77 that hit the Pentagon is a Boing 757 (they got that right) - but it does not have a Pratt&Whitney as claimed in Loose Change - it has a Rolls Royce engine. <br /><br />2. The voice morphing technology they claim the government uses for faking the phone calls is not ready for LIVE conversations. The technology is only able to morph recorded voices. It's evident that the conversations that the passengers had with their loved ones were live conversations.<br /><br />3. Most of the calls were carried out on air-phones and not cell phones<br /><br />4. The movie claims that $167 billion in gold was stolen from the basement beneath WTC 7. This is more than 50% of the gold in the entire world at that point. Do you have any idea of the logistics that would be needed to transport that amount of gold?<br /><br />5. It claims that Osama Bin Laden is not wearing rings where in fact numerous photos show Bin Laden wearing rings.<br /><br />And there is probably a lot more. But that's not all - the "documentary" uses every trick in the book called "how to manipulate the viewer":<br /><br />1. They leave out the thousands of facts that speak against the conspiracy <br /><br />2. They leave out the many expert reports that support the official 9/11 report <br /><br />3. They take quotes from witness testimonies out of context <br /><br />4. They leave out testimonies from thousands of witnesses that don't support the claims made in Loose Change <br /><br />5. They make a lot of assumptions and conjecture that fit their purpose <br /><br />6. They never substantiate their claims. They just throw their claims at you as if they were facts.<br /><br />The worst part of the "documentary" is the "fake phone calls" part. It really, really aggravates me to hear them mocking the victims of 9/11 - and then they have the audacity to dedicate the movie to them afterward. That pisses me off a great deal.

Give thanks to the internet. After bringing forth Nigerian money scams, phishing scams, identity theft, email viruses, spyware and stupid urban legends, now it thrusts upon us yet another abomination we have to warn all our friends and relatives about. Loose Change, and it's various 'editions'.<br /><br />First things first. Do not believe a word this video says. Sources include anti-semitic 'news' organisations, wacky mad-scientists and alternative-science 'entrepreneurs'. (But of course they don't tell you this.) When it does cite legitimate news providers, the stories are almost always from the immediate aftermath of the attacks - a confusing time when even the media organisations themselves admit they made a terrible mess of the reporting.<br /><br />If you're not careful you'll get suckered in by its logical trickery. A military document about 'Operation Northwoods', a sinister plan to stage a fake terrorist attack on US citizens, supposedly proves the government is willing to attack its own people. Yet, read the fine print: in Operation Northwoods nobody was to be killed, or even hurt; civilians weren't involved at all. And more importantly the idea never even went into planning because the government wasn't prepared to carry it out! So what does this prove again? Beware the cheap tricks to make you think the Osama Bin Laden confession video is fake. Think carefully about the astounding claims that someone stole $200 billion in gold and silver from under the World Trade Center (try calculating how much that weighs!). Ask yourself if its really possible all the phonecalls from the hijacked planes were faked. Could somebody impersonate your wife/husband without you realising? There's example after example, of dishonesty, trickery and stupidity. Take a look around the internet for the Loose Change Viewers Guide. Although a little sarcastic it lists literally hundreds of distortions, quotes out of contexts and logical blunders, and it gives the real facts behind some of the conveniently truncated quotes.<br /><br />Worst of all though, despite pleas to the contrary Loose Change is an insult to the memories of those who died, those who mourn them, and those who struggled to save lives. Without daring to point the finger directly Loose Change's innuendo implicitly accuses thousands of citizens of complicity in murder. The crimes proposed simply couldn't have been committed without the assistance or subsequent lies of local government employees, clean-up workers, medical staff, coroners, the NYPD, the FDNY, hundreds of other agencies and private companies and most importantly the victims and their bereaved relatives.<br /><br />It's an appalling, egotistical, nasty piece of work.

It seems to me people are too quick to dismiss a movie like Loose Change as crazy conspiracy rubbish. Opinions contrary to widely held perceptions are always met with resistance. In this case, to accept what Loose Change suggests is to acknowledge that your government doesn't serve the people after all, but only its own secret agenda, and that voters are just a necessary inconvenience in some sort of twisted Orwellian world we never knew we were part of, that need to manipulated to bring them around to accept the rhetoric of the day. Crazy? In all honesty this is similar to most religions that also require blind obedience. For whatever reason there are many who think their leaders deserve their unquestioning, unwavering faith and trust, to accept everything and anything that is thrust upon them as necessary and true. The path of least resistance is always the easiest and most secure, but, alas, not always right.<br /><br />That said, the fact is that much of what Loose Change describes probably is crazy conspiracy rubbish. What it offers is merely an alternative explanation that fits the facts - something that the "official account" doesn't seem to do all that well. Even if 99% of the material in Loose Change is utter garbage, what about that remaining 1%? Doesn't that deserve your attention? Alternatively, if you feel 99% of the official account is true, what about that last 1% that just doesn't fit the data? Like all theories (including scientific ones), Loose Change will undoubtedly need to be tweaked or even completely overhauled to fit any new or contradictory information as it comes to light. Why is that such a problem? Does the official account offer that sort of flexibility? <br /><br />Who knows what really happened on 9/11, but it seems fairly clear that certain parties besides the hijackers knew what was going down.

Decoys isn't fine art by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a modern edition of classic "B" horror movies. There's the requisite tentacled monsters, scantily-clad (a light bit of nudity toward the beginning of the movie) sorority girls, and a hidden killer decimating the campus population...the difference in this case being that all three are the same girls. Overall, it was fun, light on the "science" part of the science fiction, and even the dialogue wasn't painfully corny. The plot was put together fairly consistently, and the acting was good for, admittedly, relative unknowns. The special effects were good quality for a relatively small film (*I* didn't see this advertised at theaters), with excellently-rendered, snappy tentacles. The creatures themselves (the women in alien form) moved a bit oddly/unrealistically, but that's something that big-budget movies still have problems with, from time to time. I liked the mechanism of the aliens' attack and the fact that their lack of belly buttons was a dead giveaway to their true natures. Ultimately, it's not Shakespeare in the Park, but it was a heck of a lot of fun to watch. I'm looking forward to the sequel, myself.

On the whole, this was a pretty good, pretty fun movie. It definitely made me laugh out loud a bunch of times, and I thought the comedy was great. The horror was not really terribly scarey, more funny, which I kind of thought was the point, although I guess some people on this board disagreed. Although I really liked the comedy, there were some scenes that seemed out of place; everything with nicole eggert was just odd and that scene in the ambulance was kind of over the top. Some of the acting was really great. For example, Corey Sevier. And the girl who played Alex was amazing. Some of the acting left a lot to be desired though. Like the girl who played the goth sorority chick, she was just a horrible actress who made me cringe. But you know, it was a movie not made for a lot of money and I think on the whole it did a great job. If you have the chance, you should check it out.

If it wasn't for the occassional flash of skin, this film would have no interest at all. Don't waste any money on this one, wait.. not for the DVD but for television to show it. It should bomb fast enough to be on TV within the year. The only strong point is the presence of Meghan Ory, a beautifull newcommer who makes a strong showing in a waste of celluloid. Nicole Eggert's contribution is less than stellar, times must be tough after Baywatch. As for the alien babes, well, there's more interest at a Victoria's Secret TV special. Finally, the movie's logo for decoys is a representation of a spider; they only show up for about 2 minutes near the end of the film. No plot, no performance, no interest; who was the genius that made this looser.

Many elements of this movie weren't bad in concept. I can hardly fault the acting, campy style, special effects, or even the plot. Unfortunately, the movie fails in directing and editing, which trumps all the others.<br /><br />For example, the plot is basically Species, but the writing was horrid, and the characters were not believable as a result. Are you going to believe that a college kid is still flirting with a space alien after he's seen tentacles? No.<br /><br />Same for the special effects, the tentacle effects could have been great if they slowed them down by a factor of 10 or so. Again, just bad directing on that.<br /><br />It all makes you wonder how the crew burned through $5 million; they certainly didn't pay the writing and editing crew anything.

The Light At The Edge of the World marks Kirk Douglas's second filming of a Jules Verne novel. The first of course was one of his most popular films 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. But this film is far more serious and has far more adult themes than Walt Disney's film aimed for the kid trade.<br /><br />This was the last novel Jules Verne had published during his lifetime and it's a story of survival against almost impossible odds. In the original novel Kirk Douglas's character was named Vasquez which certainly was more in keeping with someone assigned to lighthouse duty on Cape Horn. But in giving Douglas's character an Anglo name it better explains his presence on the island and it certainly is in keeping with the international tradition of Jules Verne's writings.<br /><br />Cape Horn is one of the loneliest parts of the globe and the geography of the southern tip of South America. Look on a map of the many islands and rocks in that part of the globe and imagine how rough the sea is because it has only limited space. It's not without reason that sailors in all cultures say that no one is really a true sailor until they've made a voyage crossing from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean in that area. Remember also this is 1865 as Yul Brynner identifies the year and the Panama Canal had not been built.<br /><br />Which makes the lighthouse at Cape Horn an international concern which was something that is ever present in Jules Verne's writings. But then as now there are malevolent forces in the world and they are in this story Yul Brynner and his pirate crew.<br /><br />On one desultory like any other down there, Yul Brynner's ship docks at the island and kills lighthouse keeper Fernando Rey and his young assistant Massimo Ranieri. By sheer dumb luck Douglas is not at the lighthouse when this happens, but he becomes a hunted man by Brynner and his pirate crew who want to set up headquarters there and use the light to pile up as many wrecks as they can plunder. Also they want to eliminate Douglas who's now the only witness to their crimes.<br /><br />I did like this film very much both when first seeing it in the theater and now on VHS. One thing of interest I found here is that there is no ambiguity, no shadings of character. Kirk Douglas is a good guy and Yul Brynner a bad one, no one is going to walk away thinking anything else. In fact Yul Brynner's pirate captain Jonathan Kongre is the most unredeemable villain we've seen on screen since Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance.<br /><br />Definitely fans of Kirk Douglas, Yul Brynner and Jules Verne should earmark this film for their collection.

This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story was full of plot holes, the camera and cutting was confusing at best and with the acting on level with kindergarten Christmas plays I cannot recommend this film to anyone but the most masochistic viewers. Avoid it like the plague if you want horror. You might find some enjoyment in watching it if you're a C-movie buff but not otherwise. I often found myself laughing but it was laughing at the movie and actors not with them. Maybe I missed the whole point and it is not intended to be a horror movie at all but a comedy on pair with "Not another teen movie" and the likes but if that is the case there were 3 of us in the room that missed the point. A very small + for the alien suits which looked quite good, but you cannot base a movie on 10 seconds of rubber suits.

I always love it when a few angry wanna be filmmakers jump on IMDb and critique other people's work. Sure, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but when you COMPLETELY MISS THE JOKE, the joke is actually on YOU. What part of hot college chicks from another planet led you to believe this was going to be Schindler's List?! Obviously, the people who made this movie meant it to be goofy (DUH!). Too bad you can't lighten up and just enjoy the silly film that it was clearly made to be. It's entertainment. Mindless fun. Stop taking yourselves so seriously. And if you think you could do better-- move out to LA and make your movie instead of working at the Grab and Gulp.

In the cheapjack horror flick "Decoys" - which might more accurately be entitled "Sorority Chicks from Outer Space" - aliens disguised as blond co-ed bimbos terrorize a college campus by turning horny frat boys into freeze-dried fudgsicles. Luke is the freshman who uncovers the plot but can't get anyone to believe him.<br /><br />Set on one of those college campuses in which the students pursue everything but their academic studies, "Decoys" can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a straight-ahead horror outing or a parody of the genre. Unfortunately, it fails miserably at both, being neither scary nor funny, just idiotic and lame. Although there's a reasonably diverting twist at the end, the movie can't overcome its silly script and cheesy special effects. Send it to the trash bin.

The only good thing I can say about this movie was I met a very beautiful lady waiting in line and was able to trash it over coffee. Shot in Ottawa, Canada, "Decoys" hits every bad cliche in the book and then pulls one of classic bad movie mistakes:<br /><br />It takes itself seriously.<br /><br />Now, had the film makers gone for 'camp' and spun it, Decoys could have been one of those films you kept on your self and pulled it out for a good chuckle once in a while (Army of Darkness, Arena, Robojox... You get the picture). Instead, the film tries to go for our fear points and give us the heebie jeebies. The only heebie jeebies I got from this was seeing that they have a sequal planned for next year.<br /><br />Bottom line: Set your money on fire or sit through Howard the Duck.<br /><br />Twice.

My son and I settled in to watch this movie last week and had a lot of fun. It's not going to win an academy award, but it still made us laugh... a lot.<br /><br />The acting was pretty good, there were a few good scares and I think it looked like a big budget movie. My son really liked the music a lot too. I don't really know much about that, but the quality and the story were great.<br /><br />Quite frankly, I was not expecting much after reading some of the posts here... but I decided to watch it anyway and was riveted! Talk about your low expectations being blown away. I guess I'm not a serious horror fan, but I do know when something is just plain, old entertaining. A lot of movies get made these days by studios and they don't seem to be able to make a good movie that often. This one, you could see that they really cared and gave it a shot. I've heard from my friends in Hollywood that getting a movie made is just about impossible. I'm glad they made this one!

For the kind of film and the budget available it was a decent movie. The acting was fairly good. I just think that more detail should have been given about some of the character's past like Lily and Constance and their home. What happened to it exactly? How are they able to mimic human behavior so naturally and change their physical form? What do they do to their mate exactly? Luke and his female officer friend seemed to have met before. When, and what happened to them? I felt that this was the biggest drawback of the entire film. Other than that it was great. Hopefully in the sequel all these unanswered questions will be explained. If at all possible I hope to see some of the original cast returning (Corey Sevier, Kim Poirier, Elias Toufexis, Meghan Ory, and Stefanie von Pfetten). A soundtrack would have been nice. I really liked the music.

This attempt to mix two genres of American pie type and alien type does not mix well. And it seems this is due to lack of trying rather than difficulty of mixing. Such waste of time both for makers and viewers of the movie .The movie tries to follow clichés of both genres but the result is not convincing like the guy who stipends relieving of his virginity, and more unbelievable that is the caring and responsible alien type who think for a species that their survival is based on their distinction. Another unbelievable thing is the police that in camp with so much strange happenings does not suspect anything. These type of movies success is based on viewers suspension of disbelief. But unfortunately here this disbelief cannot be suspended. And this is because of lack of try on writers and director's side

Like other Canadian horror movies, this one too, is rather mild and benevolent and opposed to the recent wave of mean-spirited American productions. The story involves female aliens disguised as "hot" college girls looking to procreate. I use quotations marks because the supposedly super hot sorority chicks aren't particularly attractive. Some even look well past college age. With one exception: Kim Poirier who absolutely steals the show. What an adorable and sexy woman. She just sets the screen on fire. Why haven't we seen more of her, she can easily carry a movie and deserves more work. The movie has a soft look and there's quite a bit of focus on relationships and friendships, unlike ordinary horror flicks that are more like loosely connected gore segments. Overall the tone is refreshing and enjoyable. The script is standard with one exception, the surprise twist at the end, which I didn't expect at all, given that everything seemed standard. Movies like these should really be offered also in unrated editions, so there's more nudity and sexual situations, given the theme of this movie. I'm looking forward to seeing part II.

Genre-blending is a timeless art where regaining the interest of a jaded or exhausted audience is concerned. Unfortunately, it is also a tricky act to pull off thanks in no small part to the delicate balance between the two disparate elements. So while the blending of the sex comedy genre that has been bludgeoned to death in Hollywood with the monster mash genre that seems to have overridden science fiction looks good on paper, it requires a few things at the execution stage in order to work. The first, and definitely most important element to put in place is a clever script that blends the best of the prospective genres whilst shedding most of the worst. A good example would be Aliens, in which science fiction, horror, and action conjoin into a gripping story of human beings fighting their own worst natures. Once a good script is in place, good direction and good actors are really needed to follow. In fact, some attempts to blend genres that lack a good script can even be saved by a good director or a good cast.<br /><br />The problem with Decoys, in a nutshell, is that it has absolutely none of these things. The director seems content to set his camera in front of his subjects and leave it running whilst they run through their lines. The actors, in turn, seem to be merely reciting lines and going through the motions. This, not unnaturally, leaves the audience standing on the outside of the film's reality rather than entering it. Of course, one could recover from this by making a film that is bad or oddball enough to be funny. This is not even attempted in Decoys. The concept of aliens landing on Earth with the mission of mating with the locals in order to facilitate some sort of continuation of their species is one rife for comedy. Granted, making a credible horror out of this concept is a difficult task, as Species proved in 1995, but the problem in Decoys is that nobody even seems to be trying. The film gives us little in the way of clues as to how to respond.<br /><br />Furthering the problem is the cast. Meghan Ory steals the show as a potential girlfriend for Corey Sevier's protagonist, but when she is not in the frame, the weakness of the rest of the cast shines through like a desk lamp before the face. Nicole Eggert and Richard Burgi cannot act their way out of wet paper bags, and the latter's attempts to portray a hard-nosed detective who is convinced he is pursuing a new Ted Bundy shatter the reality of every scene he is in. Canada certainly has a better pool of talent available than this rot would have you believe. Every time one watches Bryan Singer's adaptations of the X-Men, one can see that much. The problem is that for every major talent in any sector of the industry, there has to be a dozen or so dregs. The cast of Decoys would appear to be a collection of every dreg that Canada has on offer. Sevier barely possesses the skill to appear in a menswear commercial, and aside from Ory, he is the best element of the cast. Thankfully, this problem was addressed somewhat in the sequel.<br /><br />Another strike against Decoys would be the terrible writing. At one point, we are given a scene in which one of the aliens tells the human male she is about to attempt to mate with exactly why she and her fellow aliens are there. In the hands of a great director like Bryan Singer or Kenneth Johnson, this could have turned into a plot subthread that would hook the audience as the alien in question struggles with her own nature. Instead, we are simply given more scenes in which sex and death are equated, while a level of misogyny rarely seen outside of America is on display. Granted, a motive for the actions of the characters is provided, but a good motive is like a good engine. If you do not maintain it adequately throughout the time in which you are using it, it will begin to fall apart. Characters begin to follow the protagonist's plan of action without needing to be adequately convinced, motivations change at the drop of a hat, and twists commit the ultimate sin. They are telegraphed in advance whilst making no real sense in light of the rest of the film at all.<br /><br />As I have hinted earlier, some of the problems with Decoys were corrected in Decoys 2. Aside from the addition of better cast members, better humour, and a more developed story, Decoys 2 also delivers a bit of mild suspense. Another problem in the original Decoys is that any suspense or interest is destroyed for storytelling convenience. The susceptibility of the alien race to heat above room temperature is probably the biggest problem that these characters suffer. While it is not as idiotic as making the aliens in Signs fatally vulnerable to water, it does beg a few questions. Granted, I am not familiar with Canada in any sense, but surely they must have days when one does not require an ice pick to breathe out. Even Norway has those from time to time. But by now, you might have noticed I am picking all sorts of myriad details apart regarding Decoys. And that is the biggest point I wish to make here. A good film has plot holes, but manages to distract the viewer from them. A bad film displays its plot holes and even exaggerates them by force of numbers. Decoys is therefore a very bad film.<br /><br />I gave Decoys a four out of ten. Two of those points are for a touching scene in which Kim Poirier demonstrates a third dimension to her character, and Meghan Ory. The rest of the film is a damp squib.

Decoys was a very weird film, in fact my first impression, before I read the back, was that it had something to do with monsters or aliens roaming a snow covered forest, kind of like a Windego themed movie, but I was wrong. This movie was okay, but it wasn't my favorite. The movie is essentially about these things that disguise themselves up to look like beautiful young college girls, who happen to have a taste for humans. This film is essentially a blend of American Pie and Alien, though there were some great camera-work for the attack scenes and there were some good performances, but this movie seemed as thought it was just another teen horror flick. There are also some pretty good comedic lines and situations too, however, for my taste it just wasn't there and it did not hit me right. Perhaps, I've drawn away from this brand of horror.<br /><br />The cast is virtually unknown, however, among the bunch there are notably okay performances by Krista Morin, Marc Trottier and Ennis Esmer. I think that I can safely say that the girls who played the aliens did some of the best performances. Case in point, Stefanie von Pfetten, Kim Poirier, Meghan Ory and Corey Sevier who both did pretty great acting in this movie. However, some of the "diabolical" acting was a bit silly and not the great. However, some of the performances by the male heroes seemed a bit too determined into finding the truth than any teen that I have run into. They seem a bit scripted and movie-ish for my taste. Also, despite it being a necessity to the film, there was a bit too much sex and nudity for my taste.<br /><br />The scares in this film were okay, I enjoyed the chest bursts and the spider-things, but they weren't scary, rather they were just plain weird and unexpected. They tried to be scary by having some "jump out" scares and "creature" scares, but they were unsuccessful. Though, the aftermath of which the victims' look like is disturbing in it's own sense. I can't remember that much from this movie so I regret that I cannot comment that much about the scares.<br /><br />Overall, this movie had some great intentions and some okay scares but they overshot it by making it seem too scripted and adding unnecessary sex and nudity. The performances were okay but a bit too over the top and sometimes dramatic. I guess this movie is okay as a B-movie, but certainly not one that you would want to rush out and see or spend money to buy. I think that this movie would have a greater following mostly due to the fact that it is a cult classic, but not for my tastes. This movie would appeal to you if you do like B-movies and indie films as well as cult films, but if you are looking for something that will hit you hard or really scare you, keep on looking. I wasn't a huge fan of this film.

Once I overlooked the slow moving action (at times) and hokey plot and dialogue, I found this movie really entertaining in a circus and carnival (freaky pirates, treasure, monkey, violence, wild colors in a rough landscape with spaghetti western flashbacks) sort of way. Seemed to really push the envelope for that time period in terms of gay and trans-gender undertones - what with the pirate captain's attachment to his butler and to his androgynous second in command (the character who paraded around in a dress and feathers and appeared much more interested in Will than in Arabella). I didn't even sense that the pirate captain was attracted to Arabella in a sexual way. Anyway,that made the movie all the more interesting and unique - although likely far removed from what Jules Verne envisioned.

This (cough cough) "movie" is almost semi-quasi-sorta-kinda watchable if you're not too terribly particular at the moment.<br /><br />Or, at least, it had an interesting idea premise, but the execution was overly amateurish. The excessive stupidness of some of the college students got a bit annoying after a while. You'd think that if they knew that what they saw was just an illusion hiding a slimy, butt-ugly alien, they would discount the illusion and be cautious and wary. But no-o-o-o, the dummies could always be counted on to fall prey to the alien's come-hither routine.<br /><br />Speaking of the aliens, how come they had breasts? If they're not mammals and don't feed their young with bodily secretions, how come they had boobies? The aliens were obviously fully sentient and therefore had crossed the threshold into personhood, how come they were using other people (the humans) as prey? It's sort of one of those universal no-nos that people will not use other people as prey. The aliens were very obviously total skanks, and i didn't feel sorry at all for them when they were killed.<br /><br />The movie had an interesting concept of evil aliens running amok, but the concept got bogged down with clichés and too much airheadedness and cutesypoo-ness.<br /><br />This "movie" could use a re-make, but done correctly this time. Dump out the smarminess and play it seriously, and it could be a real humdinger of a movie.

Well, this sort of sneaked up on me.<br /><br />There I was expecting a terrible little b-movie, but what I got was something cooler, odder.<br /><br />I am a great fan of "The Faculty" and my husband, Terry and I have been David Decoteau movies off late, so maybe it was a relief not to have to wipe my brow over another homo erotic escapade.<br /><br />The story is a familiar one, but it is told with some panache. The dead bodies are very coo and the dream sequences are great.<br /><br />Terry and I really enjoyed it and I am excited that there is a sequel. <br /><br />Bring it on!<br /><br />Brian

Decoys is set on St. John's College campus in New Brunswick in Canada where Luke (Corey Sevier) & his roommate Roger (Elias Toufexis) are two students just trying to have a good time, while trying to return some loose change to blonde babes Lilly (Stefanie von Pfetten) & her roommate Constance (Kim Poirier) Luke witnesses something strange & terrifying, the two female roommates are in fact aliens. Obviously no-one believes Luke but when Bobby Johnson (Mark Trottier) is found dead under mysterious circumstances Luke is convinced the alien babes are behind it & since he is blamed for Bobby's murder after having a fight with him earlier in the evening Luke has even more reason to expose the alien menace on campus....<br /><br />This Canadian production was co-written & directed by Matthew Hastings & the feeling I get from the other IMDb comments is that Decoys has divided opinion with some mixed reviews & as I write this the average 'User Rating' on the main page comes to an almost exactly half 4.4 out of 10. While I didn't think Decoys was the worst sci-fi horror film out there I wasn't that impressed with it & overall I would probably have to say I thought it was slightly below average. The biggest problem I had with Decoys is that it spends far, far too much time on boring teen drama issues & at times I thought I was watching Dawson's Creek (1998-2003) or something & the horror is kept to an absolute minimum with a few pinches of sci-fi thrown in there. The script isn't very good either, why would someone during a talent show turn up with a flamethrower, shoot a jet of flame at the crown & then just leave? How can someone enter a room with a flamethrower, use it to fry a couple of aliens & yet none of the curtains, carpet, wooden table, chairs or anything else not get so much as a singe? Why, if one of those aliens saw or even suspected she saw Luke hiding in her closet did she not do anything? After seeing someone in the closet she just leaves yet Luke must have seen her revealing herself as an alien which just makes zero sense to me if your an alien & are trying to stay incognito. Also why was one alien good & the other's bad? How did they get to Earth? How were they able to mimic humans perfectly? Are morgue's in Canada so lax that they allow any old teenager in to take a good look at his dead classmate? Do these very same morgue's leave autopsied bodies just lying around at night on any old table? Are these guy's so pathetic that when a total blonde babe goes down on them to suck their manhood they make silly faces & come up with excuses why the total blonde babe should stop. Right, I know I wouldn't. I also felt there just wasn't that much to the film, it's fairly slow, not that much happens, there's nothing in the way of mystery or surprises & there's a pointless twist ending that paves way for a sequel tacked onto the end. Those are just off the top of my head to, I could go on. I suppose if your looking for a dull teen drama with a few touches of sci-fi & horror then Decoys might be the film you have been waiting for, if not then there are much better alternatives out there that deserve your time & money more.<br /><br />To be fair the film looks pretty nice with slick production values & better than average but still nothing brilliant CGI computer effects. There's not too many memorable scenes here, there's little horror & apart from a shattered frozen arm & a brief glimpse of a rotting dead body there's no gore whatsoever. Despite lots of opportunity there's not much nudity either, I think there's only one nude shot in the entire film despite several sex scenes which all end up being tamer than tame. The aliens when revealed are nothing special in themselves & look rather dark & drab & to save on the budget very humanoid in shape. AS I have already said the film spends too much time on dull teenage angst & dramatics rather than genuine chills of which there are virtually none. Even though Decoys might have a somewhat glossy look there's very little substance here below it.<br /><br />According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $5,000,000 which amazes me, although the film does have a nice look about it & decent production values virtually nothing happens & I can't believe that amount of money was spent on this but having said that it's not impossible it cost that much. If it did then Decoys is even more of a disappointment when the amount of money the makers had to play with is taken into consideration. Filmed in Ottawa in Ontario in Canada. The acting is alright but nothing special from no-one I have ever heard of, some of the college girls are pretty hot though.<br /><br />Decoys is a film that seems to have provoked a fairly mixed reception, some seem to like it while just as many don't. In my opinion I would say it's slightly below average & forgettable & there are better films out there. A sequel Decoys 2: Alien Seduction (2007) went straight-to-video & while I haven't seen it it's meant to be terrible.

Students at a Canadian college campus are beginning to disappear, only to be found dead, their bodies frozen stiff from the inside. Luke & Roger, two students at the campus, come across two new female students. But Luke discovers that they are in fact aliens who have arrived in order to breed so that they can save their race from extinction.<br /><br />You can imagine what the executives at the Sci-Fi channel were thinking when the pitch for this film was given. "Hey, let's make a teenage version of SPECIES, set it in a college & throw in some American PIE." And sure enough, they delivered it.<br /><br />"Decoys" is exactly what you would think it is; a cross between SPECIES & American PIE, only it takes the main plot points of both films; alien chicks & horny students; & throws them in a blender. The film's intentions are clear from the outset  the way the camera lingers on female college students as it passes them, shows that the film is purely for adolescent males who want to see sex, booze & cheap CGI effects.<br /><br />That said, the film does have a number of glaring problems. The acting is not too bad, with Richard Burgi & Nicole Eggert playing their part as the two cops better than the actors playing the co-eds. The plot has some massive plot holes  why did the aliens pick that particular college to mate with? Also there's the fact that the director / screenwriter does not know who the real villains are (the aliens are shown as evil at first, but later come across as being sympathetic). The makeup effects used to portray the frozen victims are quite good but the CGI aliens are very cheesy.

I was expecting a dire film but was shocked to see just how good the camera work, direction and soundtrack was. Some of the shots were exquisite. I know thats not what these films are supposed to be about but I will be looking out for more from these directors. The story was pretty so-so but the presentation and art was superb.<br /><br />Not sure how a sequel will sit <br /><br />Screamers the Hunt is out soon - I'll look out for that as it is by the same director I think.<br /><br />Ten lines needed to post a comment - ah OK. All the cast looked great too.

Upon first viewing of this movie, you may automatically think Species rip-off. Even with the clearly lower budget it offers so much more and actually trys to be different from the average made for TV Sci-Fi weekly movie by combining a mixture of comedy, horror, and of course science fiction. The movie takes place on a college campus in Canada! Where we follow a group of students who have an American Pie type of vibe to them, by busting out jokes and repeatedly have discussions about losing their virginity and performing other sexual acts. And that's where the hot blonde sorority babes come in...and that's where the Species comparisons may come in.<br /><br />Yes, just like the Species series, in order for this hot blonde undercover "ALIEN" race to survive they must reproduce with the male human virgin freshmen. We do get some actual time to meet the characters and their stereotypes, and you do get a feel for them. It's clear to see who the lead players are and even though you know who's gonna go, you still root for them like they have a chance, something you don't see too often.<br /><br />The hot blondes in their natural form do resemble the Species creatures quite a bit, but I guess they go by the standard alien description, hairless body, big eyes, human but almost bug like. The awesome Kim Poirier actually plays one of them "Constance". She gets quite a bit of screen time while not actually being the lead, you might also recognize her from the Dawn of the Dead remake, she's got quite a memorable scene in that one! When we do see these reptilian aliens, sometimes it is real effects that do look fairly good. But for most of the action sequences the creatures are CGI but even though it's easy to tell, it still looks good since they move so fast.<br /><br />This movie also mixes in a bit of cop drama with the good cop bad cop showdown, although unnecessary it still seems to work in the entire B-Movie atmosphere of the rest of the movie. So we follow our lead college male "Luke" played by Corey Sevier as he must prove to the others that Aliens do exist and they're taking over the campus before it's too late and his friends give in to sexual peer pressure.<br /><br />The movie builds up quite nice to an inevitable showdown between the lead male and entire Alien species. We get some nice action sequences and with all the time spent actually getting to know the characters you don't know whether or not to root or boo for these aliens creatures.<br /><br />In the end, you get the expected victory with an unexpected twist. The first time I watched this movie it somehow slipped past me, but it actually seems to work quite well. I'm not gonna spoil it for you just in case you haven't seen this but keep an eye out for it when you do! This is definitely a movie you can have fun with if you don't take it too seriously, think of The Faculty + Species and a Lil' bit of American Pie and you got a surprisingly enjoyable movie. Of course it finishes off with room for a sequel and of course a sequel was made, how could they not? If you get a chance give this one a watch, even though you may have seen this type of story before, it's more fun then you may think.<br /><br />7.5/10

In St. John College, the freshmen and best friends Luke (Corey Sevier) and Roger (Elias Toufexis) meet the sexy blond cousins Lilly (Stefanie von Pfetten) and Constance (Kim Poirier) in the laundry of their building. They are next-door neighbors, and the experienced girls invite the young men to visit them anytime. Lilly forgets a package of coins in the laundry, and Luke goes to their room to return it. The room is empty, and he sneaks around, when the two girls arrive. Luke hides himself in the wardrobe, and through an opening, he sees Lilly with many tentacles on her breast. Luke tries to convince his friends that the girls are aliens, planning to attack Earth, but nobody believes in him. Meanwhile, some friends of them are found dead, with the internal organs completely frozen. <br /><br />"Decoys" was a great surprise for me. I bought this DVD because of its low price and the beautiful cover, but without any reference. When I saw IMDb Rating, I thought that I might have lost my money. However, although having some flaws in the story, the movie is very funny and attractive. In the end, I found IMDb User Rating very unfair and "Decoys" very underrated. The surprise in the last scene was excellent. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Decoys"

They can seduce anyone, the tag line reads. But it doesn't seem to apply to virgin nerds as they keep resisting. A college campus is current home to beautiful aliens out to seduce young men. A difference in body temperatures usually results in the guys being left frozen stiff.<br /><br />Enter our virgin nerd and his ability to resist the naked charms of the aliens (even when he thinks they are normal). The real question is not why the aliens are here, but are they good or bad. Are they intentionally killing guys or is it an unwanted side effect? That question helps drive the second half of the film.<br /><br />When all is said and done, this really just seems like a college sex comedy. Sure it has aliens and death but there is no real tension to make it really qualify as a horror film. No real comedy either (but that is common with a lot of sex comedies). There is a sequel in the works that is either just trying to make a quick buck or might actually explain some of what happens in this movie. Good for eating popcorn to as it requires little thought or attention.

Set in a New Brunswick college town,our heroes are a pair of easy going roommates named Luke and Roger.After sneaking into a sorority girl's room to return some quarters,Luke spies the girl sprouting tentacles in front of her friend-who's casually huffing liquid nitrogen.Luke reasonably comes to the conclusion that the two are aliens-though none of his friends believe him(he was drunk at the time).After a pair of suspicious deaths,Luke becomes convinced he's right and begins investigating."Decoys" is loaded with fake scares and plenty of bad CGI imagery.The almost complete lack of gore and violence is also hard to forgive.There are some mildly humorous moments,but the pace is rather slow and the acting is weak.So if you want a proper and intelligent Canadian horror watch again "Ginger Snaps" or check out late 70's slasher classic "Rituals".

Where do I begin, to tell the story of how bad a movie can be?<br /><br />Here is a list of the tripe which makes this movie a sham:<br /><br />1- College-age sex scenes masked as drama. <br /><br />2- Aliens coming out of any orifice of one's body. (Writers, please stop writing movies with this as a plot element. It is so overused that only a writer with no imagination would be tempted to use this now stock piece of "alien occupation" as anything even remotely approaching originality.) <br /><br />3- Bevy of blondes and bimbos used as an element to demonstrate the cultural diversity of the average population. (Here it comes off more as an element to bring in the little boys and their salivating glands..if not a cringe or two from this viewer.) <br /><br />4- An ending which is so predictable to be almost blasphemously criminal. (Who of you who have seen this movie did NOT see this coming?) <br /><br />5- Hard-rock soundtrack in place of a real one. <br /><br />6- Direction and editing which strikes a new low in vapidity.<br /><br />Only one scene even approaches the word "good": <br /><br />***********PERHAPS A SPOILER***********<br /><br />I am talking of the scene where Elias Toufexis has a sensitive encounter with an alien near the end of the movie. In this scene and in this scene only does one get a taste of the acting abilities of Toufexis. He demonstrates a very believable range as a young man who will do just about anything for real love. I hope we see more of Toufexis. He shows real promise.<br /><br />************END OF SPOILER*************<br /><br />Othewise, this movie was a terrific waste of an evening. I do not recommend it for anyone but the youngest sci-fi aficionados who may not yet know the difference between a sci-fi movie and a sci-fi film.<br /><br />Doink!

One of my favorite films of all-time. Unusual because the pirates depicted in this movie are all too real. None of the romanticizing Errol Flynn or Jack Sparrow stuff. These pirates were shockingly ruthless and a real sense of danger permeates the film. Yul Brynner and Kirk Douglas bring intensity to their roles. Brynner as the egotistic sociopath who is the leader of the cutthroats and Douglas as a man who must deal with a desperate situation in a fight for survival. Samantha Eggar as a woman with flawed instincts for her own preservation evokes frustration and pity. From the brutal opening scenes, the message is clear that these pirates don't play. A sense of urgency then takes over until the final outcome. A great movie!

Flirtacious Lily (the stunningly gorgeous Stefanie Von Pfetten) and aggressive Constance (the equally foxy Kim Poirier) aren't your standard run-of-the-mill tasty hot blonde college babes. They are actually dangerously alluring and enticing extraterrestrials who have come to Earth to mate with human males. Unfortunately, these delectable intergalactic honeys cause men to freeze from the inside out while having sex with them. Plus they sprout icky tentacles when aroused and don't have navels. It's up to aimless slacker freshman Luke (winningly played by Corey Sevier) to stop them before they turn every last libidinous party hearty dude on campus into giant frosty popsicles.<br /><br />Director/co-screenwriter Matthew Hastings has an absolute infectiously inane ball with the enjoyably ridiculous premise, skillfully blending raucous humor and off-center horror into a highly amusing and entertaining synthesis. Moreover, Hastings keeps the pace speeding along at a brisk tempo, elicits spirited acting from a fresh, attractive and appealing young cast, and stages the shock scenes with rousing go-for-it aplomb. Daniel Villeneuve's crisp, fluid cinematography, the catchy, thrashin' rock soundtrack, the nifty special effects, a smidgen of nudity, genuinely likable characters, the shivery'n'spooky score by Daryl Bennet and Jim Guttridge, the stirring conclusion, and a dandy surprise twist ending are all up to par. Elias Toufexis is an amiably goofy hoot as the sweet virginal Roger, Meghan Ory registers strongly as Luke's scrappy'n'spunky best gal pal Alex, former "Baywatch" TV show regular Nicole Eggert pops up as a feisty lady cop, and Richard Burgi jerks it up delightfully as a gruff homicide detective. Good, solid tongue-in-cheek Grade B sci-fi/horror fun.

(MAJOR SPOILERS) Low-budget B-grade Canadian horror flick is the same vain as 'The Faculty', where aliens disguised as humans have become a part of the campus. Except all these aliens inhabit a college and happen to be hot chicks who love cold weather, and mating men- except, err, the men don't survive the process, and they literally turn into frozen corpses. Of course, this all baffles the police, yet one guy is onto these dastardly hot girls.<br /><br />And that guy is Luke (Corey Servier), who happens to witness two of the ladies in their room spring tentacles out of their chest. Of course, none of his pals believe a word he says, and they all want to get laid. The Detectives think he did it. And his good lady pal, Alex (Meghan Ory), is the only one willing to help him- and, of course, she actually wants to be with him, but he can't see. Don't get me started on the tacked on ending involving them! If the movie wasn't tacky enough, the ending doesn't save it.<br /><br />The acting from the guys is generally bad. Corey Servier is a likable hero, but he needs to act better, and the guy who's playing the wannabe homeboy couldn't act to save his life! Elias Toufexis does the best as Luke's virgin frat buddy, who gets involved with one of the so-called chicks, but his performance is up and down. The girls do better acting wise, but then again, they act as the standard cliché eye-candy too. There is an interesting turn in the story, which could have made the film decent- involving Toufexis' Roger, and his alien girlfriend, but the filmmakers ruined it with unbelievable character actions and unconvincing acting. Soon after that, we get memorable lines from Luke such "how about the belt of O-FRYIN!' which really displays the B-grade aspect of this movie.<br /><br />The cinematography and visual effects are pretty decent, and I guess 'Decoys' doesn't take itself too seriously. I wish it did! Even within the context of the plot of the movie. The acting is so unconvincing, that it "feels" like a movie, and the storyline had potential to take an interesting turn, but of course, they had to have that tacky cliché horror-movie ending! Not the worst I've seen, but this was still extremely bad! <br /><br />*½ out of *****! (1.5/5)

I think I must be feeling generous giving this movie a 3. It's probably not even that good. A good measuring point of a movie is how many time you pause it or walk away WITHOUT pausing it. I did each several times.<br /><br />The movie did get to the point / horror of the movie quickly, which is good. Unfortunataly, a movie about blond alien women who 'love' dudes to death, better have some serious nudity. Sadly, this was missing.<br /><br />Missing as well, was a plot, characters you can believe or truly gorgeous women. (Why would Nicole Eggert sign onto this movie? She's good looking, but she's in a freakin' parka the whole time!) Did I mention the FX? No, that's because they're better left unsaid.<br /><br />The twist at the end...never saw that coming...<br /><br />Skip this flick.

Not really, but a sleeper holiday flick for your Xmas party back pocket. I hadn't even pegged it as a holiday film until the ultimate scene. Nice! Stefanie von Pfetten is a scream queen gift to the masses -- one I need to catch up on -- and the movie, while not awesome, combines horror and humor elements to good effect. The loss of the hero's friend isn't overly convincing or deserving of much mourning, and the exchange student scene at the sorority house is slightly unnerving, but on the whole, this is a fun flick worth watching once. I don't really understand IMDb's 10-line text limit for reviews. Is it 10 lines of written text -- in form? -- or on screen? I guess I'm about to find out. May the 65% of this review actually commenting on the movie serve you well.

This might surprise many, but i stick to what i feel. I liked this movie. The best part of this movie was the perfect background score given behind particular scenes. There was emotion, romance and comedy in it to make it worth watchable.<br /><br />Agreed there were many similar movies of these types. But one thing i can say, this one is slightly a cut above the rest. There was no stretching of any particular scene. In other words, you wont get bored and say like " Oh Cmon, get moving, isn't there anything else?" In fact there are some instances where you would wish that the scene would go on for a bit more time.<br /><br />The actors gave a decent performance and the supporting cast also made their presence felt. So all in all i would recommended this movie to teenagers. It is somewhat similar to Trojan War released in 1997.

"Decoys" is one more of those new low budget horror movies that are coming straight to video these days. However, "Decoys" shines among the rest of b-grade films because of the simple fact that it is quite funny and entertaining despite its clichéd storyline. This is no "Ginger Snaps" (the Canadian horror cult-film) of course, but it is very close to be great.<br /><br />The plot follows the adventure of Luke (Corey Sevier), a young man in his first year in college, who just discovered that the two beautiful students he just met are actually murderous aliens who kill every guy they have sex with. Of course nobody believes him, and the movie follows his lonely attempt to prove he is not insane. To make things worse, his best friend Roger (Elias Toufexis) is currently dating one of the aliens and is very interested in losing his virginity this year.<br /><br />With a storyline like that one would expect a cheap and dumb teen movie, but "Decoys" manages to keep the interest and the laughs at a good level without becoming stupid or boring. In fact, it slowly develops the characters and one can't avoid to feel for them. Something quite rare nowadays. This is director Matthew Hastings' first feature and boy he did it notably well for a debut.<br /><br />The acting is very good for the most part, although Corey Sevier is a bit weak for a lead role. On the other hand, Toufexis shows a lot of potential in a remarkable performance as Luke's friend that goes beyond being a simple comic relief to become a likable and interesting character. The same could be said of Kim Poirier, who in her role of the alien Constance shows that she is more than a pretty face and sexy body.<br /><br />Of course, like the plot implies, the movie displays its fair share of nudity; not only of Poirier, but also of the beautiful Stefanie Von Pfetten. Fans of these actresses will be pleased.<br /><br />The film has the obvious flaws of a b-movie film, although some of the CG effects are very good. the script its a bit flawed and has some plot-holes, but nothing minor or too distracting. Of course it could had been better, but it is OK for the movie. Also, the film drags a bit by the middle but it recovers its power for a very good and clever ending.<br /><br />"Decoys" may not be a horror classic, but it is a very funny mix of horror, comedy and sci-fi. Hastings, Toufaxis and Poirier show a lot of talent and probably they'll have a bright future ahead if they continue this way. This was really a surprisingly entertaining film. 7/10

Hush is a film that lacks credibility because the plot is more or less unbelieveable. The mother character (Played by Jessica Lange) has a dream that she believes must be fulfilled at any costs. On route to this happening, the story is wasted by using unnecessary characters, loathsome acting and what seems to be the same scenes shot over and over.<br /><br />Jessica Lange is the highlight of this film. Her performances always seem to steal the show and it is no different here. Now if her choice of films to make were a little wiser, she probably wouldn't have signed on here. Palthrow does well with what she has. Those expecting a "Shakespeare" like performance won't get one because the credibility of the plot takes away from all of the performances. Gwyneth has few opportunities to really act and for some reason is always having her face touched. Why?<br /><br />The cinematography is average mainly because of the natural beauty of Virginia in the (early?) winter. The film progresses at a torrid pace during the first half-hour without any character build-up that would have formed a bond with the audience. As a scene ends it always seems to tell what is going to happen in the next and this is rather annoying as well. The director only wanted to rush to get to the climax of the film not saving time for any real development.<br /><br />I don't see how one could really like this film, since it lacks so much. Watching the scene with Lange and the grandmother at the retirement home is about as bad as it gets. There is really no point to that scene of the entire film itself.<br /><br />4/10 stars.

Good movies are unpredictable if unrealistic. Has anyone, I wonder, suffered through this film for any other reason than being a Gwyneth Paltrow fan or wanting to see if Jessica Lange has aged gracefully?

I don't know about spoilers but all those cynical negative comments might spoil my pleasure if I was easily influenced or if I let them, so my simple advice to any film lover is : just watch it and you might just enjoy it. I certainly did. I do not wish to say anything about the plot, the characters and the acting and filming qualities except this: Jessica Lange is great as the seemingly sweet and soft mother, Gwynneth Paltrow is thoroughly convincing as the frail bride and mother to be, Jonathan Schaech is at least adequate, the plot is haunting, so yes, I repeat, just watch it and enjoy it !!! One of the most gripping movies I have ever seen. (Manlyn, a viewer in Switzerland)

Greatly enjoyed this film and the wonderful photography of New York City and beautiful scenery in various Historical Towns in Virginia, namely: Charlottesville, Culpeper and Orange, Virginia. Jessica Lang,(Martha Baring),"Big Fish", '03 played the very over powering mother-in-law to Gwyneth Paltrow,(Helen Baring),"A Perfect Murder",'98, who is very much in love with her husband and there are many scenes where they are making love most of the time. Jessica Lang is very protective of her son and even goes through their luggage looking at Helens method of Birth Control. Nina Foch,(Alice Baring),"A Song to Remember",'45, a great veteran actress, gives very important information to Helen Baring concerning the Baring Family past secrets. If you look close, you will see Hal Holbrook,(Dr. Franklin Hill),"Purpose",'02, giving advice to Martha Baring concerning prescriptions for horses. If you love Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Lang, this film will greatly entertain you from beginning to end.

After viewing this film and trying to understand why a family would try to welcome a Nazi Youth into their family, who had all kinds of hatred for all people and was brain washed by monster's who killed Thousands upon Thousands of Jews and many other races. I realized this is only a Hollywood dream works during 1944, which was probably quite amazing to the public who viewed this film. Fredric March(Mike Frame),"The Iceman Cometh",'73, and Joan Carroll,(Pat Frame),"Tower of London",'39, did their very best to help their adopted Hitler Youth, Skip Homerier,(Emil Bruckner),"Halls of Montezuma",'51, try to adjust to the American way of living. Emil was a devil on wheels who did everything horrible you can even think about doing. Betty Field,(Leona Richards),"Birdman of Alcatraz",'62 and Agnes Moorehead,(Jessie),"Dragon Seed",'44, gave great supporting roles to this twisted story. Just imagine if we tried to adopt Usama Bin Laden's son into our homes today, I doubt very much if this film would win an Academy Award. I am happy to say that Skip Homerier did play a fantastic role in "Halls of Montezuma",'51 as Pvt (Pretty Boy) Riley.

This movie was without a doubt, very predictable. There have been a hundred other movies made with basically a similar plotline. But I still enjoyed it, simply because I enjoy this type of movie. Jessica Lange gave a great performance as the deranged mother in law. It's fun to watch, even though you know how it's probably going to turn out in the end. I think everyone should at least give this movie a chance. It's worth watching.

I thought it was a pretty good suspense film. I also thought Jessica and Gwenyth did a good job. My only complaint is that they gave away who the killer was too early in the movie.

i liked this movie. in it, gwyneth paltrow plays helen, who becomes pregnant and moves in with jackson, played by johnathon schaech, and his mother. everything takes off from there. im not telling what happens, but its a good movie. i give it 6 and a half stars outta ten. if you have the money, go rent it.

Having read so many devastating reviews and comments on this movie, why even bother watching it. Still there was something about the storyline that drew my attention. And yes, it was entertaining. Not a Hollywood classic but the quality acting of both Jessica Lange and Gwyneth Paltrow made it worth enjoying. A 7/10 for this film.<br /><br />Ernest Hamstra

This movie resides on my top 10 of all time list. Sadly enough, I came up with a story concept not entirely unlike this story for a novel. Maybe this is why I was so enthralled by this film. Spoiler ahead!! Don't read any more if you don't want to know what happens towards the end!<br /><br />A mother's love for her son becomes more and more prominent ending in a suspenseful crescendo, where you can feel the Helen's suffering and powerlessness as she is thrown into a situation out of her control as she struggles for her life through labor pains. The rest of the film builds quite well up to this, as you are slowly shown the depths of the mother's obsession with only son.

When Gyneth Paltrow's character blows her cookies at one point in the film, I couldn't help but feel she was speaking for everyone in the audience. Well, maybe that's stretching things a bit, but "Hush" manages to rise only to the level of a mediocre made-for-tv flick on the USA network...the kind that would have trouble winning its 3:00 AM time slot against cable's worst info-mercials.<br /><br />The acting ranges from NOT BAD (Jessica Lange) to EMBARRASSING (Jonathan Schaech). The screenplay is utterly predictable despite the fact that everything has to go totally wrong - or the characters act really stupid - in order to push the plot along. This movie would be perfect fodder for Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Despite all of the negative reviews I've read, (and there are plenty!) I actually liked this movie. The writing is quite good and even though there requires a certain suspension of disbelief in the plot, the characters remain true to form. Lange and Paltrow I consider to be two of the best actresses around today and they truly carried the film. The film builds a psychodramatic suspense in the characters of Lange and Paltrow that transcends the shortcomings of the plot details.

I loved this movie. Jessica Lange is very convincing as the controlling , vindictive mother-in law to Gwenyth Paltrow's seemingly unsuspecting Helen. Jonathon Scheatch (what a hunk) is the believable, niave son, does a fantastic job as well. Nina Foch is awesome, where did they get her? Overall, a great suspense-thriller

Okay, I can certainly admit that the plot isn't original, and that things get predictable on more than a few occasions, but I still thought that this was a great movie. I tend to enjoy movies with truly hateful characters, and I thought that Jessica Lange played her part wonderfully. Paltrow and Foch also were effective in their roles. Yes, some scenes are melodramatic, and some are even hard to believe, but that's not always a bad thing. This type of movie is supposed to be a little over the top, after all. So, even though this movie takes us through some familiar territory, I still thought it was a lovely ride.

Hush is a real masterpiece. Three of the finest actors going around star in this and they all play their parts extremly well. Jessica Lange as Martha is the perfect women to play this character she had a good grip of it.<br /><br />Gweneth plays Helen brilliantly as that innocent but wise new wife. And Jonathen is good as the moddie coddled son.<br /><br />The location is a perfect 10 out of 10. I fell in love with Kilronin what a beautiful place. Hush builds and builds to a climax, The climax i must admit could be a little better, but maybe the director was thinking a like myself of a possible sequel.<br /><br />Jessica Lange full marks to you though a great role in a good film of the 90's where it may show what some mothers inlaws are actually like, no offence

Fast transfer of a smash WWII B'way play is both fascinating and unintentionally ludicrous. An OTT idea ('typical' American family take in a German refugee relative and find an unrepentant Nazi Youth!) is given an OTT treatment, right down to Louis Applebaum's balmy background score. Character actor turned megger Leslie Fenton can't camouflage a penny-pinching budget and he certainly doesn't hold the actors down. (Skippy Homeier's award-winning perf as the Nazi boy is berserk.) Yet he pulls off a remarkable chase/fight climax that's like something out of F. W. Murnau. Even Henry Sharp's lensing comes to life, recalling his glory days shooting Doug Fairbanks classics & THE CROWD. (Bump down your brightness level to increase the 'grey scale' on this Image DVD edition.) With naturalism out of the question, pros like Fredric March, Betty Field & Agnes Moorehead all succumb to heightened stage manners, but they still can't pull off the simplistic humanistic psychological ending. The story might make a bit more sense if the kid remained the monstrous automaton we first meet. Put on your own double bill with Roger Corman's THE INTRUDER/'61 and see who decides to follow the Leader.

I went to see 'Shakespeare In Love' because it won the Oscar for Best Picture. I didn't like it (simply not my cup of tea), but I just loved Gwyneth Paltrow. One of the most wonderful performances of the decade. Then I saw 'Great Expectations', another delightful performance, and right now she's one of my favorite actresses. What do you do when someone's your fave actress? You scan their filmography looking for other movies to watch. I ran through Paltrow's list on IMDb and came across 'Hush'. The 4.5 average rating didn't look too promising. Then my sis also told me she thought this movie was awful, but I decided to rent it anyway.<br /><br />The movie tells the story about Helen, Jackson and his mother Martha. Helen gets pregnant, they marry and go live with Martha in her giant house. Martha's very possessive over Jackson. More and more it becomes clear Martha's not the nice mother-in-law she appeared to be. She's spreading lies between the two lovers and things get worse. This all leads to a, looking back on it, predictable sequence of scenes.<br /><br />But... there's Jessica Lange. She plays Martha. She really got on my nerves. Actually, when the movie was over I completely hated her. She does a fantastic acting performance. I really wanted to strangle her sometimes. Her character that is. Gwyneth Paltrow plays a quite vulnerable and likable young woman. That combined with the evil Lange caused this movie to be suspenseful for me. Really. It was predictable, but it was the kinda movie where we (I anyway) so want the heroine to win over the evil character. It is not the best movie ever made, but I was really sucked into it, especially because of Lange's perfect portrayal of an utter bitch.<br /><br />So I can't believe why this movie only got 4.5 out of 10 here on IMDb. I overall liked it and grade it much higher:<br /><br />8 / 10

I just rented this last weekend and it is a bomb. I am so surprised to see Jessica Lange in something like this. This was totally predictable, but nothing really ever happens. The end is pretty evil, but why didn't they build up to it? Gwyneth Paltrow was so bland, and Jonathan Schaech, who smoldered in "The Doom Generation", was even duller(keep in mind, they have very little to work with). Would you believe a baby is born, yet no one bothers to call a doctor? HELLO, plot hole. Go weed the garden, watch a dog grooming contest, ANYTHING but suffer through this one.

True, the ending was lacking in continuity, and left one with a sense of disappointment, but my husband and I rather enjoyed this movie.Contrary to other comments below, Jessica Lange and Johnathon Schaech did fine jobs! Lange was very convincing as the mother-in-law from hell. There were times when it seemed like scenes had been cut because things didn't make sense, but it wasn't too hard to ignore that and fill in the blanks ourselves. Nothing great, but amusing to watch.

OK, the reason they called this movie "Hush", is so that you would be quiet in the theater while everyone was sleeping. What a dull film. It dragged on for the first hour, until Gwyneth was "ready" to have her baby, then you think the excitement might set in. yippee-ki-yi-yay. When the most invigorating thing in a thriller movie is a bitch-slap, you know something's wrong. Attractive leads do not mean a good movie... 2/10

I don't know whether they give Oscars for casting, but if that is the case, the person responsible for casting for this film must be at least a nominee. I'm just amazed how such established actresses as Lange and Paltrow have been agreed to take part in this 'plot is thinner than silk-paper'-film (blackmailing? ;->). Every scene is predictable and the story itself has been told thousand times. There aren't any camera-angles that make you say 'wow, nobody thought of that before' either, so the end-result is very average. I'm all too aware about the existence of bad mother-in-laws, so this one just didn't cut it for me... 3 out of 10.<br /><br />

This movie starring Jessica Lange and Gwyneth Paltrow has great talent, but the production company obviously spent all its money on the stars' salaries. A film about Kentucky Thoroughbred racing should be filmed in Kentucky, not at a show horse farm in Virginia. The Kentucky Blue Grass region is uniquely identifiable, as is Virginia horse country -- and the two are not interchangeable, even in fiction. It is like making a film about New York City in Los Angeles. Did they think no one would notice? And there are plenty of Thoroughbreds in Virginia, so why did the filmmaker try to pass off big, fat show horses as racehorses? The scene at the horse sale and all its errors are even too ridiculous to mention.<br /><br />The technical adviser on this film was either asleep or inept, because a scene does not pass without a glowing inaccuracy. Especially noticeable to anyone interested in horses who watches this movie (and I can't imagine anyone else would) are the dangerous ways in which the horses are handled, usually by people who are recognizable as amateurs at handling a horse. The most glaring fax pas surrounds the drug oxytocin that Jessica Lange's character removes from the cabinet: the label clearly states "erythromycin tablets." Again, did the filmmaker think no one would notice? <br /><br />Literary license is one thing, but this movie goes way, way beyond that and into the depths of the toilet.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it ten years ago. The film reminded me of some of my favorite Hitchcock flicks, namely Shadow of a Doubt and Notorious. The story builds slowly and generates just enough paranoia of impending danger to keep the audience interested. By the time everything comes together, the audience has an emotional investment in the main character and experiences genuine anxiety at her ordeal. This is so refreshingly different from the movies that slice and dice cardboard characters in an attempt to generate suspense.<br /><br />After seeing how poorly people have reacted to this film, I revisited it to see if my memory served me correctly. My assessment remains the same. Jessica Lange gives a stellar performance as the homicidal control freak. Gwyneth Paltrow is easy to empathize with as the paranoid daughter-in-law. Nina Foch is hysterical as the cheerful old lady who knows all the family secrets. I have met each of these characters in the real world. The only reason I would hesitate to call this a masterpiece is because there is no Hitchcock cameo. Still, this is a worthy imitation of the master's work.

First let's get this out of the way. I have never been a fan of Gwenyth Paltrow, I never understood the fuss surrounding her. She has two expressions one with her mouth is pouting and one of bewilderment. The pouting technique is in high gear in this movie. Now that is over I have to say that for once I actually liked her character. She wasn't some dumb bunny who had to be hit over the head with a brick before she noticed something was up boyfriend/husband mom. Strange the first time I saw them as a couple going into their loft in downtown NYC they looked like John Kennedy Jr and his wife. I am not sure if that is the image we are suppose to get. Anyway there is grandma in the mix which we nothing about until the wedding. And we find out she wasn't invited, she mentioned something about chasing down catering trucks to find out about the wedding. It was hilarious. Right away that should give the viewer who has yet to see the mother is nuts that something is wrong. The new husband seems to be clueless. Actually they could of used anyone including a dead Orson Welles for the part because the hubby really has nothing to do but just be a plot device. He is hubby, son of a nut and that is his role. We find out that the the son also owns the ranch mommy lives on and runs. Another hint something was not right. THen we see that he blames himself for his dads death. It looks like they made that up while they were filming the movie. Because before that we just saw a perfectly normal guy with a nutty mom now we see a victim. Well before all of this she finds out she is having a baby and they get married. One day coming into her loft she get assaulted. This locket which had already been a conversation piece between mommy and daughter in law comes up missing from the assault. Her dead parents picture is in the locket. Now we know Gwennie is all alone without any family other then her future hubby. In other words a perfect victim. OH boy we all know that locket is going to show up again. Why do people in movies keep remnants of their bad deeds?? Throw the stuff out. In any case she is afraid to live home, mommy is threatening to sell the horse farm. So son decides to make a go of the ranch. They move into the house. The hubby is really not seen too much after that other for some occasional nookie and seeing running the ranch. Like I said a dead Orson Welles could of played the part. Mom starts doing some piggy things and Gweenie is astute enough to see what is happening. There is a scene at this horse show and Gwenie sees grandma, she wants to go talk to her and mom tells her she forbids her to talk to her. Well Gwennie turns around and mentions she hasn't been forbidden to do something since she was a teenager. Good for her I say!! She goes to see the grandma but mom yells her name and a horse gets excited and almost harms a pregnant Gwennie, Well Gwen gets off the ground and Yells at mom and tells her "You didn't have to yell" She is not letting up on mom one bit, I loved it. Oh before I forget mom hears Gwennie telling her son that she talked to his grandma and he should see her. After that mom makes a visit to the Home of the Hardly Living (what the grandma calls the nursing home). And warns her to keep away. I swear she was going to kill her in the heating machine but she didn't. Gwen goes for a visit too and finds out that mom was basically a gold digger SURPRISE SURPRPISE! She eventually lets her know that the son didn't kill the dad and he wasn't leaving the mom because of a affair. Well now we know that mom is letting her son take blame for killing his dad. Oh boy. Another thing it seems the mom is interested in male offspring's only. Why we never find out but it is very weird. Heck the whole movie is weird. Gwen who has been smart up to a point all of sudden gets dumb and eats this piece of cake mom insists she eats. The poison induces labor and we see her give birth as mom is talking about the pain. Something she talks about through the movie. Weird. Before that scene we see mom has already got a room ready for the baby and Gwyn is mad. That is why I thought it was out of character for her to eat that cake. Orson Welles shows up eventually after the obligatory wish washy scene and leaves with his wife. Nothing is done about mom and her criminal behavior. I guess they are leaving granny who is a tough nut to take care of it. It is one of those so bad it is god movie. Take a look if there is nothing on. One last thing I find Jessica Lange, who I think is a very good actress always uses cigarettes as a prop when she is playing sassy or devious women, she does it here. All you have to see is her bring that cigarette put it between her fingers hold her hand up and move it backwards palm up out and you know the role she is going to play.

Probably neither. Difficult to understand all the negative reviews for this enjoyable and well acted movie. Domineering ambitious mothers do exist. Some of their sons, however good looking, are sometimes both stupid and heterosexual.

Someone must have told Gwyneth Paltrow and Jonathon Schaech they're starring in a serious drama because they're no fun at all in this try-hard attempt at camp. On the plus side, Jessica Lange gets it right because she's as camp as a row of pink tents playing the MIL from Hell with a weird fixation on her cute-but-dim offspring. Hardly a scene goes by without her lighting up or hitting the bottle and her Blanche Devereaux accent is anything but subtle. Judging by the evidence on hand Jonathan Darby couldn't direct traffic but he certainly knows how to write genuine shockers: "Get up! You think you're an alley cat, dropping its litter by the side of the road?!" Jessica makes the most of the over-ripe dialogue so it's worth a look, but if you want to see it in a good movie check out Wild at Heart, with a deservedly Oscar-nominated Dianne Ladd as the ultimate evil, martini-swigging southern matriarch.

This was a film that got a rather high score in the Leonard Maltin Guide--saying the film was "still potent". Well, I was excited about seeing it, as I love American WWII propaganda films and have seen a huge number of them. Unfortunately, while the original stage production of the play and the subsequent movie made quite a splash, the whole thing seems terribly dated and poorly written today. The bottom line is that the film lacks subtlety and has plot holes big enough to fly a B-17 through them! The movie begins well enough, as Frederic March (a fine actor) is in the lead. But my hopes were soon dashed when the little Nazi boy (Emil) comes to live with them. First, it's hard to imagine the Nazis letting a boy leave the country to come to the US while we are at war with them! Secondly, it's hard to imagine the US government just accepting the kid without making sure he wasn't a spy or an America-hater. But regardless, here appears a 12 year-old boy who often sounds quite German (he uses German and English interchangeably) but his accent also wavers a bit--almost sounding Swedish or Polish from time to time. I guess you can't blame him that much, as this is a VERY demanding role for a young boy. But who you can blame are the writers who immediately throw subtlety out the window. Instead of the kid pretending to love America or creating trust with his new family, he immediately acts like the local chairman of the Hitler fan club--even showing up to his first meal dressed in full Hitler Youth regalia (including an armband). Now I don't know about you, but if I'd been alive during the war and a kid moved in with me and preceded to parade around the house in Nazi uniform spouting hate, I think I'd be a bit peeved! But, March and the rest try to show him understanding instead of turning the brat over to the FBI!! Plus, while March works on top-secret military plans, he does a lousy job of securing them so Emil isn't able to steal them. Also, you'd think when he went to school and began spreading hate and Nazi propaganda that the school would have taken more notice. No trip to the principal's office, no phone calls home and no contact with the local police. It just defies all common sense to think that during the war anyone would have been allowed to act this way without being arrested is crazy. America DOES have freedom of speech, but for a foreign national spreading pro-Nazi propaganda during the war, this is ridiculous! Now if this was the only problem with the film, I guess you could chalk it up to naiveté. Unfortunately, it got a lot worse. Emil spread anger and dissent everywhere but no one actually did anything about this...so far, so good. BUT, after 1001 warning signs AND when he then tries to kill two people (by beating one with a fireplace poker and then trying to stab another), you'd think the kid would have been deported or arrested or even shot! But, in one of the worst endings in film history, they stupid family feels sorry for the kid and decides, like the Beatles once said, "all you need is love". To make matters worse, the girl who was beaten with the poker was March's own kid and the lady who convinces March not to press charges in the end was his Jewish fiancée!! Yecch!!! What drivel. The film just doesn't make sense and becomes tiresome because of all this.

An absolutely awful movie I watched only because of Gwyneth Paltrow who I had previously admired greatly. Not so much now. Shame on her for being party to this load of rubbish. It started off quite promisingly, well actually the wheels didn't start coming off until burglary/attack on Paltrow when it was blatantly and painfully obvious that the mother had arranged this. No explanation of the reason for this. Things went rapidly downhill from there, yes the scenery was attractive if you like that sort of thing but credit for that is due to mother nature not the cinematographer. I think the second worst aspect, after the terrible story line, was Lange's acting.<br /><br />Incidentally, Oxytocin is rendered useless in the digestive system and is only effective if absorbed through the mucous membranes or given intravenously, and even then has a half life of 3 minutes I believe, so it would be totally useless taken in food. Also if my mother-in-law had treated me like that when I was in labour and then tried to kill me with a lethal injection I would not have stayed in the house even for a dramatic denouement the next morning.<br /><br />Then the son, after being led around by the nose by the evil mother does a complete about face in the space of a few minutes on the strength of his wifes unsubstantiated accusations.<br /><br />A rubbish movie best avoided.

This stands out as a camp classic of the Joseph H. Lewis variety: there's even a threatening gadget, in this case a steam cabinet. Don't go into this expecting a deep movie and you'll have a lot of fun with the deliberately over-the-top characterizations

This film is quite disappointing, especially considering the big names in its cast. Paltrow is good as always, and Lange is convincing too. But the weakest part is the plot. It lacks any coherence and cannot really convince, even if you watch the film without too much attention (like I did). **Warning: major SPOILERS ahead!** The end is the worst: Jackson got very close to his mother - then one morning Helen tells him she tried to kill her, and he immediately believes her, changes his mind and decides to leave. Even worse: having found out that the woman is a deranged murderer who already killed her husband, they just leave her there without doing anything about it (what about calling the police!?), and go on to leave happily ever after. I give it 4 out of 10.

Jonathan Darby is credited with the writing/directing of this misconceived movie. As an auteur, Mr. Darby, doesn't bring anything new to the medium. "Hush" proves to be a total waste as it appears Mr. Darby had nothing in the way to control the over the top campy performance of Jessica Lange.<br /><br />Ms. Lange is at her worst as Martha, the evil mother behind all the scheming in the film. Her love for her son, and hatred for her daughter-in-law, gives the actress an opportunity to do some of the worst emoting in any film in recent memory. Gwyneth Paltrow must be questioned for her choice of material. Didn't she smell the aroma in reading the script? Oh well, let's hope she was able to ask for millions of dollars for appearing in this turkey. Jonathan Schaech doesn't fare better. Nina Foch is the only one who comes out the best in her small role of Alice, Martha's wise mother-in-law who has seen right through what's going on.<br /><br />This is a film to watch with friends after having a few drinks, then one might enjoy the "masterpiece" some avid fans thought "Hush" was.

I am quite frankly astonished by the low imdb average for this film. I thought it was a more than respectable suspense thriller. It definitely kept me riveted throughout. Gwenyth Paltrow, who was offered Kate Winslet's part in Titanic at the time she committed to this project, devles into her role as the unsuspecting fiancee with grace and down to earth affability. But this is clearly Jessica Lange's film. Her psychotic mother-in-law is one of the most disturbing characters I have come across in any film. In my opinion this film rates an 8/10.

Though this movie was somewhat slow and predictable it brings out the worst side of Jessica Lange. She had an outstanding performance as the evil Mother-In-Law to Gweneth Paltrow. I have never seen her in a role as evil as this one. I believe that Gweneth showed the strength and heart of her character. She lost both her parents, was mugged in her own home and then stands up to her Mother-In-Law to prove to her husband what an evil person his mother is. Way to go!!! Personally I liked this movie. What the movie doesn't bring out right away is the lengths that "Martha" will go to take the baby and keep her son on the farm. This movie is one of the best suspense movies that I've seen in a while.

Michael J. Fox, Ed Begley,Jr and the legendary Kirk Douglas are ALL likable performers- no question about it. Too bad they're stuck playing TOTALLY despicable and UNlikable characters in this movie! After being introduced to one greedy, scheming relative after another for the zillionth time, WE GET IT! The love of money is EVIL-DUH! Even those characters the audience is *supposed* to think are likable (Fox's too-loyal girlfriend and principled hippie dad)fail to be. The girlfriend keeps threatening to leave Fox if he doesn't walk away from this mess- again and again. After the zillionth empty threat instead of thinking he's risking losing a good girl (like the script would want us to believe), I got the idea she was JUST as unprincipled and manipulative as the rest as she definitely STAYS to the end. Oh, and his dad was portrayed too much like a utopian hippy to be believable.<br /><br />I DO urge everyone who has the chance to watch the opening credits for the Late Jimmy Durante to sing his signature song of 'Inka Dinka Dinka Doo'! Durante definitely steals the show because he is the ONLY vaguely likable character in this whole movie! Yeah, Fox does a good imitation of Durante but is it worth going through the REST of the movie to see? I think not.

from the comments I saw here, I thought I was about to see one of those rare, forgotten comedic gems, the cast definitely offered hope. However, this was disappointing, there were a couple of good one-liners but this was more a drama than a comedy and a drama that seemed to drag and drag.<br /><br />Apart from Fox and Douglas, everyone else was one-dimensional and seemed to be saying the same stuff over and over again. There was real scope here for a wittier script, instead it all got rather tedious, 30 minutes could easily have been lopped off the running time.<br /><br />At least it was good to see actors like Douglas, Fox and Hartmann in their prime, its sad to see what has happened to that trio now.

A comedy filled with entertaining characters, Greedy fails to be a successful film due to a tedious plot.<br /><br />Dirty old selfish Joe is rich and his snivelling greedy relatives want his money, so far, so funny. However, the structure of Greedy is badly done. The film starts with one of Joe's greedy relatives, Carl and his family. It is a mistake to make us side and sympathise with them, if ultimately they are not important or developed. Worried they are going to lose out on their inheritance to sexy young nurse Molly, the bickering relatives call in long-lost nephew Danny, Uncle Joe's favourite. Although Michael J Fox is a welcome addition to any film, and his energy, wit and compassion make him a watchable lead, he is introduced too late to be this lead. Danny either isn't needed in this plot of greedy relatives versus evil old man, or it should start with and focus entirely on him. It is very difficult to care about his failed professional bowling career, as it is boring, and the sappy music that follows Danny and girlfriend Robin around is far too overdone.<br /><br />While child-Danny and Michael J Fox-Danny's impressions of Jimmy Durante are impressive, the need to show the audience who they are doing impressions of by starting the film with a lengthy clip of Jimmy Durante from Two Girls And A Sailor makes for a slow beginning that has little to do with the film.<br /><br />Molly is a badly written character. She knows Joe is perving on her, but she likes the lifestyle he provides and eventually she nearly sleeps with him for money, and yet she isn't supposed to be that sort of girl. Well, she clearly is. Also Olivia d'Abo is apparently English so it is confusing that her English accent is one of the fakest I have ever heard. Exactly what part of England is she from?<br /><br />The plot plays out pretty obviously, excluding Joe's insanely over the top ploy to discover who loves him, with bad people getting nothing and good people being rewarded, but it is the despicable Joe who has ruined his family's lives. Without him, they would never have become the people they are, so to see them end up with nothing, while he is still rich isn't satisfactory at all.<br /><br />Amusing characters suffer an irritatingly twisty plot, dominated by a detestable patriarch and are buried under too much moral for this film to be as funny as it wants to be. It should have stuck with the idea of relatives who will do anything for their inheritance and dumped the morals of Danny and manipulation of Joe, which just hinder the laughs.

Simply a great movie. Michael J. Fox trained with one of the greats, Johnny Petraglia for months in preparation for this movie. Fox went from a hack casual bowler to a respectable 175 average. Not good enough to actually throw the shots he was supposed to throw in the movie, though. The makers of Kingpin and Big Lebowski should have seen this one before making a mockery of the game. Any bowling lover should not miss this one.

**SPOILERS** Coming over to the Frame home in rural USA to be taken in as a member of the family young Emil Buckner, Skip Homeier, is anything but your typical American boy in fact he was brought up in Nazi Germany and brainwashed to grow up and become a future Aryan Superman in the Hitler Youth. That fact that Emil's dad who was thrown into a Nazi concentration camp where he eventually died for speaking out against the Fuhrer, Adolph Hitler, made Emil look suspicious to his Nazi overseers who felt that he may well become like his dad, normal, when he grows up. The Nazis decided that he didn't have what it takes to become a good and loyal member of the Nazi Party and sent packing to the US to stay with his old man's brother-in-law Mike Frame, Fredic March, and his future wife Leona Richards, Betty Fields.<br /><br />Not getting the hint that he was a total wash out, in him not having what it takes to be a good Nazi, from his beloved Nazi Germany Emil ,because of him being brainwashed since he could barley walk, still thinks that he's a full fledged Nazi Superman and goes so far as to parade around the house, this in 1944 when the US was at war with Nazi Germany, with his Nazi or Hitler Youth uniform. Emil makes a complete jerk of himself in him trying to be a spy for the Fatherland and at the same time blowing his cover, by bragging about it, and not realizing that the Fatherland, wanting nothing at all to do with this nut, had him unceremoniously kicked out!<br /><br />Acting like a Nazified version of "Dennis the Menace" Emil is all over the house and even at school trying to prove to everyone, including himself, what a great Nazi Superman he really is. For a while Emil does get his classmates to go along with his crazy antics that he picked up back in Germany while in the Hitler Youth. Emil has his classmates take night marches into enemy territory and staging roadside ambushes, all in fun of course, while being disguised in camouflage so that the enemy, whoever he is, can't see them as well as familiarizing themselves with all kinds of arms and ammunitions, German of course.<br /><br />Emil goes a bit too far when he first comes to deal with Leona, his Uncle Mike's fiancée, being Jewish as well as his determination to steal Mike's mail that he gets from the War Department. Mike is one of the country's top chemist and is working on a top secret project for the US military, the Atomic Bomb?, and Emil wants to get his hands on what he's doing by stealing his private notes and mail and send it back to the Fatherland. In the case of his future aunt Leona the fact that she's Jewish is enough to drive Emil batty in thinking that he'll be forced to live under the same roof as she is when she marries his Uncle Mike: a fate worse then death itself for the cute but somewhat not all there in the head little Nazi. <br /><br />Two things happen that turn Emil around in his mission, or what he thinks it is, in serving his Fatherland. Confronting Leona about her being Jewish, in the most vulgar of ways, she slaps Emil across the face that shocks the very self-assured and arrogant young man in him, ,an Aryan Superman, not only being whacked by a lowly woman but a Jewish one at that! The second incident that brings Emil back to reality has to do with his getting into a fight with fellow student Stanley Dumbowski, Rudy Wissle. Stanley being a Polish/American whom Emil felt to be inferior to him was able to take him on and give him a bloody nose and even later force Emil, with their teacher Miss. Richards looking on, to apologies to him in front of all his classmates; What An Insult!<br /><br />With all his arrogance about being a good Nazi now in question the only thing that can bring back Emil to his fantasy world of serving Fuhrer and Fatherland is to get his hands on Uncle Mike's secret papers and send them back to Germany, by US airmail?, to show everyone back home what a good German, or Aryan, he really is. Emil is stymied in his plan to serve the Fatherland when he's caught red-handed, with his hands in Uncle Mike's drawer, by his young cousin Pattie, Joan Carroll, who just bought him a birthday present, a illuminated watch which he always wanted for his crazy nighttime war maneuvers. All at once Emil graduated from just being just a pesky and uncontrollable but somewhat harmless young boy to a possibly up and coming psycho killer the very type of person that would make those back in the Fatherland, the Nazis, very proud of him.<br /><br />Intriguing movie about how a young man can be so seriously brainwashed that he goes against his best interests to serve a country and ideology, Nazi Germany, that did nothing but harm him and his family. Where at the same time having him try to destroy, in his own childless way, the country and its people that did nothing but help him in every way it and they could despite his dislike of both of them.<br /><br />Emil does see the light at the end the movie, or tunnel, in how he was treated by his Uncle Mike and especially Leona, a Jew who in his mind is the eternal enemy of his beloved Third Reich, as well as his victim of violence Pattie in the kindness and understanding as well as love that they all showed to him.This kindness and understanding is something that he never would have gotten, if he did what he did here back there, in Nazi Germany.

I suppose saying that the end of this movie is great gives something away. Then again you don't know what that is so maybe not.<br /><br />The plot of this film has Kirk Douglas dying as all of his relatives try to curry favor and get left his fortune. When every trick in the book fails they call in Michael J Fox as his long lost favorite nephew. Fox is now a down on his luck pro-bowler desperate for the cash the family promises him.<br /><br />Some of what follows is sit-com material, some is highly inspired. The good part of it is that almost all of it is funny.<br /><br />Certainly the film as a whole is not the best thing down the pike, but it has its moments, all of which make this film worth seeing.

Kirk Douglas,Michael J Fox and Nancy Travis star in this hilarious movie. Joe Mc Teague (Douglas) is an old man with a big supply of cash.His nieces and nephews have each followed a way to convince him he should hand the money to them. Along comes Danny (Fox) and his girlfriend,Robin (Travis) who Joe thinks should have the money.However,Joe's "nurse" Molly,(played by Olivia D'Abo) has her own plans! Everyone has their own plans to capture Joe's money.But he has his own plans and he's not gonna let it go easy! Look out for Colleen Camp as Patti.<br /><br />Memorable scenes include the scene at dinner where all the family secrets are uncovered.<br /><br />A Memorable Quote: (Carl (Joe's nephew) has commented to fellow sibling Patti,how he had the decency to be early to Uncle Joe's weekend party) PATTI:Well,at least we had the decency not to put Frank's sperm in a machine to separate the X's from the Y's!There is a line below which we will not go!(to her girls)-Joelene,Joette-come along.

Greedy has taken some of the plot situations in the Paramount classic If I Had A Million and carried them to incredible heights. It has a whole string of good performances topped off by one of the last performances by Kirk Douglas before he had his stroke.<br /><br />Kirk plays the Richard Bennett part here, the millionaire who doesn't like almost all of his relatives, but gets a certain sadistic joy in seeing them perform like trained seals, trying to stay in his good graces. The only honest one of them is one of Ed Begley Jr.'s young sons who is just like that kid in If I Had a Million who started playing that record of I'll Be Glad When You're Dead You Rascal You.<br /><br />Unlike Bennett, Douglas does not decide to drop parts of his fortune on eight random strangers. He just keeps putting his family through their paces until they decide to dig up Michael J. Fox, a nephew he actually liked when he was a kid.<br /><br />Fox is a second string professional bowler who's got a TV producer he's involved with, Nancy Travis. The two of them invade Douglas's three ring circus of relatives and get put through their paces also. All the family is against Douglas's 'nurse' Olivia D'Abo who the family is afraid will get the whole inheritance.<br /><br />Greedy is a nicely paced amusing comedy which I think most of us can identify with. I know I've had a relative or two I can't stand either, but am forced to be nice to for a variety of reasons. The relatives are all greedy, but Douglas is one sadistic creep as well. I'd catch it the next time it's on the tube.

I was forced to watch this movie with a friend. I have never heard of it until then. I found out that Micheal J. Fox was in it so I decided to watch it. It started out very different and then I was shocked to see how the family memebers were treating each other. This movie was a comedy, but a drama as well and I loved it. The humor was different, but funny all the same. I really, really liked this film and this is a deffinate purchase.

Greedy is a film you may have passed on Showtime, or glanced at in the TV Guide and thought, "never heard of it". To be honest, I can't recall its stint in the theaters either. However, on the recommendation of my father, I gave it a chance.<br /><br />The interaction between all of the characters is terrific. Phil Hartman gives comic brilliance, mixed with wit and sarcasm in his usual way. <br /><br />This movie has a lot of laugh out loud moments for people who are into clever comedy with a slightly twisted mind. It is cemented in my comedy top 5 with Stripes, Planes Trains and Automobiles, Ferris Buellers Day Off, and Ridgemont. Highly recommended! 9/10

Saw it before, and watched it again last night, even though I normally don't watch films twice. Period.<br /><br />I think this is a brilliant film.<br /><br />The humour in it is great, even though I knew what was coming. I mean: the fact that I remembered some of the lines from watching it a couple of years ago, while I can't remember what I had for dinner yesterday, speaks for itself. In my book anyway. :-)<br /><br />Regardless of the comments, by others or myself, this film deserves a chance, so if you've never seen it I heartily recommend watching it. I'm (pretty) sure you'll love it.

LIGHTHOUSE <br /><br />(USA: Dead of Night) <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound format: Dolby Digital<br /><br />Inmates and officials from a sunken prison ship become stranded on a storm-lashed lighthouse-island 300 miles from the UK coastline, along with a monstrous psychopath (Christopher Adamson) who stalks and kills them, one by one.<br /><br />Writer-director Simon Hunter's powerhouse shocker - an award winner at movie festivals in Luxembourg and Rome - combines the setting of TOWER OF EVIL (1972) with the multiplex-friendly aesthetic of Wes Craven's SCREAM (1996), and improves on its source material in every significant way. James Purefoy (RESIDENT EVIL) and Rachel Shelley (CRUISE OF THE GODS) lead a small but talented cast of newcomers and veterans (including Paul Brooke and Don Warrington) as a motley bunch of hot-heads and cowards, forced to band together in a desperate attempt to survive the killer's rampage.<br /><br />The film's narrative is linked by a series of Hitchcockian set-pieces (a potential victim cowering in a toilet stall as the killer lurks outside; a terrified character trapped in a boat with a two-way radio which could betray his presence to the prowling maniac at any moment; and two prisoners chained together at the wrist who are forced to make a terrible decision during an unexpected encounter with the bloodthirsty killer), culminating in a terrific climax at the top of the lighthouse, where Good and Evil collide in a welter of stuntwork and visual effects. Hunter emphasizes suspense and atmosphere over violence, and his clever script maintains an impressive degree of logic, isolating potential victims through careful calculation rather than narrative contrivance. Lovely, evocative music score by Debbie Wiseman, too.<br /><br />Incredibly, despite being co-financed by BSkyB and the Arts Council of England, and despite a warm reception at various festival screenings, LIGHTHOUSE remained on the shelf for three years before creeping into UK cinemas to lukewarm reviews and poor business. It fared little better in the US, where the movie played briefly in theaters under a new title (DEAD OF NIGHT) before being consigned to video hell. It's commercial history notwithstanding, this is a small classic, ripe for rediscovery.

Unbelievable that a movie like this has been produced in 1999; if it had been from the sixties I wouldn't have been surprised at all. It is full of cliches, it is terrible predictable (I watched it together with a friend and told him exactly who would be killed and in which order by the time they arrived at the lighthouse!) and awful music - completely identical to the kind they used to use in the earliest horror movies I can remember. I really can't think of any reason why someone might want to see this movie.

Don't see this movie. I stopped watching after 15 minutes or so... This is terrible acting, there is no story and I couldn't figure out what was happening and why anyway. Just don't do it.

It's a dark, stormy and foggy night when a ship transporting prisoners sinks. The survivors (doctors, officers, boat crew and jailbirds) crawl to the shore of a desolate island, find refuge inside a large lighthouse and have to fight off one of the escapees, who happens to be a psychotic killer. He burns up a rescue boat and the communication equipment and stalks the characters with a machete.<br /><br />High-pedigree slasherama from England has the novely of above-average production values and acting and some well-done suspense scenes to go along with some pretty grisly slayings (neck slashings and decapitations being the killer's forte). They just forgot much of a plot, the b/w flashbacks linking the killer to one of the characters doesn't work (what a coincidence!) and it's all so dark, miserable and rainy the whole time. A few good set pieces, but a sense of humor and better-developed characters would have helped.<br /><br />Score: 4 out of 10

I saw this movie and found it extremely puzzling. The child, Emil, is the least sympathetic character I have seen since, "The Good Son." Emil is cold, calculating and manipulates the other characters with no conscience whatsoever.<br /><br />I found the ending the most curious of all. Emil attempts to murder Pat, and because he cries over it, and confesses the Nazis kept him in a dark cell for what his father did, the family forgives all. This seems to be a recipe for disaster. The end credits roll, but does anyone believe a kid that tried to kill before won't try to do it again when he doesn't get his way? Nuts!

Where do you begin to summarise a film like this? The start I guess. Oh wait - there isn't one. You know you're in for a rough time when a film's opening drops you into a scene that feels like you've somehow already missed 10 minutes. Who are these people? Where are they and what hell are they doing? The director/screenwriter doesn't bother with any of that. They're people on a boat. With a bad man. Who escapes. That's about all you're getting folks. What then follows is some of the worst direction, acting, editing and photography you will ever have the misfortune to witness. It's truly mind numbing that a film with such horrendous technical deficiencies could ever pass muster. They should have dropped the final cut of this mess into a vat of acid and tossed the director in after it. That would have spared us this nonsense and any other ideas Hunter may have in his head.<br /><br />0/10

There was a movie. With a lighthouse. A serial killer is loose and the audience is agonising, and not because the film is terrifying. The film is terrifyingly bad with awful characters, awful acting and an awful end. The serial killer was the ugliest bastard I'd ever seen, and he does not utter a word throughout the movie!!!!The whole film has a strange surrealistic atmosphere, as if the actors had been teleported into a parallel bad movie dimension. The "traumatic scenes" of the movie were more like comedy than anything else, like some awesomely bad joke told by my sister. By watching this movie I experienced no feeling of being entertained at all, it is definitely good for the trashcan.

The tension in "Lighthouse" is pretty unbearable. In fact, you don't even have to like or care for any of the characters (phew) to feel the danger as much as they do. I mean, this killer is just really creepy, for once I didn't want him to finish the job, he's not the funny, playful mass murderer like Jason is. There are whole bunches of exciting scenes in this movie, it's not exactly Hitchcock but it'll do. We get lots of typical scenes: the standard fat guy sequence, people splitting up for really vague reasons, the supposedly highly-educated stupid woman being stupid and annoying all over the place, a lot of fire, the works, filmed to perfection. Not written to perfection but it's a slasher, nobody cares.<br /><br />The only thing that's really too bad is that the killer stopped being mysterious by the end. He was just like a Bond-villain after a while, even with the idiotic laughter and everything. That really spoiled things. I suppose I shouldn't make a big deal out of it but I do.

Even though Lighthouse doesn't exactly deliver a story that anyone would consider as original (some people are stalked by a merciless serial killer on a deserted lighthouse), it is a surprisingly watchable movie. Director Hunter adds nice twists to "classic" stalk-scenes, and the movie is chilling right from the beginning. The killer surely is a creepy figure and possibly makes you gasping for breath sometimes. The only letdown for horror-buffs like me is the fact that there's not much gore in this movie - but the few bloody scenes are staged very well and surely not for the squeamish. All in all a chilling and entertaining thriller: 7 out of 10.

Very disappointing foray into slasher movie territory which misses one central pre-requisite for the genre, towit, if you're going to abandon your plot and characters you have to have blood and ingenious visceral carnage by the bucket-load. Which this film clearly does not. Bar one Argento-esque scene in which the ships Captain is stalked by the sloth-like killer in a toilet, the rest of the set-pieces are poorly constructed, badly lit and downright tedious. I hate to admit I actually fell asleep during this one (I can't imagine that happening during the best horror exploitation pics of Fulci, Deodata and the like.) The crashing soundtrack doesn't help our comprehension of the lame brain plot either. And is it just me who found the killer thoroughly unthreatening to look at? (maybe he should have worn a hockey mask or something....) Has all the directorial style of an end of term film project on a limited Arts Council grant, to which I have but one closing comment: must try harder in the future!

This is the sort of film that gives horror films a bad name, not as a result of graphic violence or for exploitation of women. BUT simply becuase its such a rubbish film. Please Simon (Writer & Director - so you have to take responsibility) think really long and hard before attempting another film. <br /><br />Why is the most dangerous killer in the UK being taken to an island prison on a rust bucket ship with just ten others. Why has thew ship only apparently got a crew of 1 ! Why don't they just fly him to this prison - we see a helicopter later in the film !<br /><br />How come the killer manages to slip past people in the lighthouse - there's one stairs yet he manages to appear on different floors, by-passing those above or below.<br /><br />Even though people are killed by having there throats cuts there's never any blood stains on the floor - just on light bulbs or toilet bowls<br /><br />Why is everyone so stupid ... I'll run away for ten seconds then not be able to find my way back, even though I have a torch and a radio. And the island is illuminated by the lighthouse light. Instead I'll stumble on to the boat that the killer has hidden.

First there was Michael Myers. Then came Jason. Followed by Freddy Krueger.<br /><br />And now we meet Leo Rook, a psychotic killer who likes white shoes and to collect heads. On his way to prison he escapes from a boat which later crushes into a rock and sinks. A few survivors swim ashore on an island with a Lighthouse, unknowing that someone is already waiting for them.<br /><br />Though an unknown cast and director, this is a very scary and most of all good movie.<br /><br />

LIGHTHOUSE (dead of night) is without question one of the best thrillers to come out in years. How this gem fell through the cracks I'll never understand. (Though in the states, blaming A-pix for it's forced, inappropriate title and amateurish B-grade box art is a good place to start!) Perhaps the film is just too sophisticated for the slasher set and too gruesome and effective for thriller fans. It deserves a genre all it's own. above all else it exists as an exercise in suspense and a very successful one at that. Sporting vividly realized, even brilliantly conceived scenes of terror visually reminiscent of Argento's best and pacing that could only be compared to that of the young John Carpenter, LIGHTHOUSE should be seen by anyone the least bit interested in Horror or good film making. One of my favorite scenes involves a flashback/dream sequence so beautifully composed it evokes the Great German expressionists in it's vague shadowy ambiguity. (When was the last time you rewinded a scene in a horror movie to watch it over again?...Sad isn't it?!) Before the film ends, it miraculously transforms genre yet again into full throttle action as the heroes find themselves dangling outside the lighthouse in a final showdown with the madman. The background sets in these scenes (orange grey skies, endless ocean) are as glorious as something out of old Hollywood or the films of the great James Whale. How teenage dreck is released into theaters while brilliance is shoved into a videobox with a generic skull on it is anyone's guess. This film deserved the same release as other harder to classify, Adult genre films like THE CUBE, RAVENOUS and EXISTENZ. Expect to find LIGHTHOUSE in years to come referred to as an overlooked classic and expect it's Director to be on the forefront of the next wave of horror.

Visually it looked great, but it fell into madman hacks people to death in unimaginative ways with no suspense or caring for characters crap video territory very quickly. It's all been done before and a million times better in loads of other straight to video slasher shockers. Tony Imi was too good for them!

The movie was incredible, ever since I saw it in 1977 I told my wife she had to see it, it was really funny. Right up there with the "In-Laws." As soon as it came out on video we would watch it. Well, 20 years later, and every time I ask in a video store they give me a funny look. Does anyone have any clue how this classic can be viewed??? "PLEASE HELP"

Could probably be summed up as reasonably entertaining, predictable nonsense.<br /><br />Every scene moving one to the other was so predictable. In fact you could say everything that happened could have been foretold within the first half hour. <br /><br />It would be wrong to judge the acting as there was none, but in fairness the film did not need to be acted out. Rather than acting, basic motions were more than adequate given the plot, the location and the fact that it was pitch dark all of the time. <br /><br />However, it did entertain in a fashion. Whether this was down to the predictability of the storyline or whether it did really entertain I'm not sure. <br /><br />I'm glad I neither specifically paid to see at the movies nor paid for it at the local DVD hire shop (watched it on a TV movie channel). But why do I still have this weird notion that I quite enjoyed it??

This is an entertaining and interesting film, as much for what it doesn't say as for what it does.<br /><br />Our depiction of small town middle American life circa 1944 is wildly inaccurate and glorified, but this is not at all unusual in films of the era. World War II era audiences would have considered themselves morally superior to the Germans and had no argument with life as seen in "Tomorrow, the World!". In reality, however, it is unlikely that a Jewish woman would have been a teacher in a largely protestant public school, and even less likely that she would have entered into an interfaith marriage with the only protest being raised by a small foreign boy. And if one considers how the story would have played out had the character of Leona been black, she not only would have never been teaching in a white public school, but had she and Mike Frame sought to be married, there likely would have been a response from the community that involved a lynching and thus our moral superiority over the Germans is exposed as being more imagined than real.<br /><br />None of which particularly ruins the film. It requires no greater suspended-disbelief than Superman or Dracula, and on its own merits this film is an enjoyable experience. However sanitized, small town 1940's America is a place one almost cannot help but to long for. And into this idealized world enters Emil, a character that at first comes on ludicrously overplayed, and yet pulls you in just the same. The audience quickly becomes concerned for what will happened to the Frame family, and the guilty pleasure of watching this pre-"Bad Seed" demon will keep you on the edge of your seat.. After what Emil does to Pat, the vigilante justice meted out by Pat's school-mates is shamelessly gratifying to see. Throughout the story one keeps secretly hoping for Emil's redemption, and it is the film's greatest drawback that it attempts to grant this wish in a quick and unrealistic throwaway end. This inadequately explored issue as well as the intriguing and thoroughly under-utilized subplot of Emil's manipulation of Jessie leave the distinct impression that someone demanded a great deal of running time be shaved off of this film.<br /><br />"Tomorrow, the World!" still gets major points for at least attempting a subject matter few films of its era, outside of propaganda newsreels, would dare touch, and it's worth a watch.

After looking at all of the comments, regarding it as an awful slasher, I must say in my opinion they are totally wrong.<br /><br />This had all the gore you need, maybe it could of had more, but still has a bloody edge, and the effects wern't all the terrible, even though towards the end when the woman is being grabbed by her hair when she's hanging off the Lighhouse does look a little bit stupid. This actually had above average acting, the characters arn't as wooden as some actors. But it is a B-Movie, and this has proudly made it's way into my top 5 in slashers.<br /><br />I'd give The Lighthouse - 7.5/10<br /><br />God bless British horror...now go watch Cradle Of Fear (Ultimate cheese, awful acting and terrible dialogue = a must for any horror fan like me)

It has to be said at times our British film industry seems to only cater for lovers of middle-class romcom action. However, there's a nice undercurrent of vicious, tense horror movies with a little touch of something different coming out of the UK as well. I've been thrilled by My Little Eye and Creep this year, and just as I thought the year was drawing to a close, I watched this little gem.<br /><br />I love the slasher sub-genre, so it's nice to see some of my fellow countrymen getting in on the game. Lighthouse is quite similar to 80s classic Maniac Cop, in that you see Leo Rook constantly but not in ways that reveal anything of him until the end. He's a nasty fella as well, decapitating all and sundry and collecting their heads in a boat. So, top marks on creating a memorable villain.<br /><br />One of the hurdles slashers normally fall at is that they're now too restrained. Scream made it okay to be clever as opposed to scary, and while that's okay, some recent movies have felt more like an x-rated version of Lizzie Macguire than a slasher. Not a problem here, Lighthouse is in possession of tension you could cut with a knife (no pun intended) and loaded with excruciatingly long, nerve-wracking and drawn out chases, often finishing them with sequences of shocking violence.<br /><br />It's odd that the movie that most encapsulates what the slasher sub-genre is missing is British, given our history of faintly operatic vampire/devil worship movies, but it's the truth. Hopefully our native directors will continue this tack of releasing taut, nightmarish horror thrillers and I'll no longer have to put up with the slew of US teen-horrors and overblown SFX pieces coming from the other side of the pond.

It's not that this is a terribly awful film, but it would take at least some effort to view it at this point. I tried numerous download sites, checked websites after i read favourable right ups. It is not worth the effort.<br /><br />A sub standard, weak, predictable and at time plain awful plot, bad acting, no real threat. Save your time and do something more productive.<br /><br />I would recommend that rather than watching this you spend the time looking for other, better, films to watch. <br /><br />If you've somehow stumbled upon this title, the odds are you will find another one that's much better in no time.

With all this garbage they call horror coming out these days, you almost automatically become skeptic and negative-minded towards smaller productions before you've even seen them! My expectations on "Lighthouse" were very low (actually, I had none) but it turned out a pleasant surprise and it's really not that bad at all. This even is  do I dare to use the word  a GOOD chiller with a no-nonsense plot, some atmospheric tension, impressively staged set pieces and even a couple of authentic shock/gore sequences. Don't expect originality, of course, as the screenplay is primitive horror material with a psychopath stalking and butchering a small group of people in an isolated setting. This setting, however, is very appealing since it's an island with only an ancient lighthouse on it and the people are survivors of a sunk prison ship. Following the old-fashioned Jason Vorhees traditions, the killer carries a machete around which makes the murders nasty and body country fairly high. Every cliché you can name features here, but I personally couldn't care less because this is a fun and unpretentious thrill-ride and nothing more. The Leo Rook character is the closest thing to a scary psychopath we horror fans have seen in years and writer/director Simon Hunter deserves some praise for knowing his classics. There are a handful of terrific sequences, like the actual shipping accident and the 'Vertigo'-like camera-work inside the lighthouse. The extended sequence in the loo is damn close to brilliant!

England's most notorious serial killer - the fictional Leo Rook - stalks castaways at a desolate lighthouse in this surprisingly eerie chiller from Britain. Very atmospheric and very gory, as the gaunt killer (Charles Adamson) hacks his way through the supporting cast, comprised of his former keepers and cellmates. Pretty scary stuff despite director Simon Hunter's formulaic "stalk 'n' slash" approach. Heads will roll (a total of six, I believe) before the explosive ending.<br /><br />Even a jaded horror fan like me found plenty of nerve-wracking sequences to enjoy -- especially the lighthouse toilet scene. So, by all means, grab your rowboats and head for the mainland before Leo Rook catches up with you.

This movie is a lot like the movies High Tension, and Creep. It revolves around a lighthouse with a killer on the loose, knocking off every few minutes one more casualty. Although the story is nothing original, the writing, and directing are top-notch and worthy. The movie looks, and feels like a high-budget, blockbuster movie. From my Country of Origin, this movie has a very thrilling and is one of the best slasher films I have ever seen.<br /><br />This is the first lighthouse type movie I have ever seen, and I think it will remain the best for a while (in my perspective!).<br /><br />For the overall work and amazing atmosphere, I give this movie a cheering 9/10.

I watched Dae Jang Geum from DVD. I was more convince by my best friend Jory . i had always associate Yeong-ae Lee with a sort of saccharine , sweet piety but watching it showed a different side and made me admire her deep humility, a virtue that is strange to us now a days, Yeong ae Lee infuses her character with beauty , wit, and intensity. I personally enjoyed the period of settings, customs, " Cooking demo" colorful costumes, etc. as well as finding the character believable and engaging. I recommend this film to anyone of any age, who is looking for uplifting, true story , that will make you laugh and cry ones in a while..Mabuhay!!

this series is stunning in every way..the story of Suh Jang Geum, the first woman to ever become the personal royal physician is a gripping story with more plot twists than a plate of spaghetti. the series follows Jang Geum's life in and out of the royal palace in 16th century Korea. Without giving anything away, i just want to say i found the characters very inspiring, as well as entertaining. from a production point of view, the beauty of the sets/costumes, art-dept stuff, the acting from all the major characters was incredible, the story was completely fascinating and the characters were just awesome. if this is the stuff they get to watch in Korea, i'm jealous. i'm thinking of moving. Also, on the DVDs i got (3 box set Korean produced) the English subtitles were really good. which, as someone who mostly watches non-English language movies, is a HUGE point in their favour!!

This is my all-time favorite drama! The OST is absolutely amazing. The plot is captivating, the acting is outstanding, and the actors are well fit for their roles! This drama is so colorful and inspiring in every aspect, and it represents, especially to me a different Korea, a different way of life. The storyline displays Korean way of living in the 16th century, and emphasize an ancient culture. The culture of royal court cuisine, traditional medicine and outfits. Dae Jang Geum's determination, courage and kindness make her a model for imitation. A girl that becomes a woman, a chef, a first female royal physician and a mother despite all hardships. Min Jung Ho's devotion and faithfulness throughout the whole drama, make this to be one the best love stories ever!<br /><br />If you have yet to watch this drama, make sure you do so!

I am a fan of DJG/ Dae Jang Geum/ Da Changjin. A huge one! Last year, I watched those movies on ch 55, avoiding DJG at all costs, because one of my friends told me,"So ancient...don't watch!" One night, I was bored out of my brain. I switched to ch 55, and guess what was playing- DJG. Since I was so bored, I decided to watch anyway(This is the one when the miso tastes funny; in a bad way, so Jang Geum and Han Sang Goong investigates). And holy crap: I was drawn to it. I stared at the TV until the end, and I was officially HOOKED.<br /><br />Every night, I watched watched watched... even 'preaching' to my friends about it. The friend who told me not to watch it was also hooked. In fact, practically my whole class was hooked.<br /><br />This drama series is both funny and soul touching. Lee Young Ae is a great actress; it is undeniable. Choi Pan Sool, the merchant who monopolized the palace's goods, has such solid acting that every time I see him angry, I feared that he would burst a blood vessel! Truly memorable.<br /><br />This is about the story of Jang Geum, a palace maid who is an orphan, but adopted by Kang Dook Gu and his wife, 'Qiuxiang', I assume (It is later mentioned that when Jang Geum's house was raided by Yin Mojie's men, all letters were taken, and all of them were love letters from Kang Dook Gu to his wife, and the letter always starts with 'Blah blah blah Qiuxiang'. That part is HILARIOUS). She is exceptionally bright and goes under the wing of Han Sang Goong. However, due to Chois' meddling, the two were exiled to Jeju island as slave-servants, in which Han Sang Goong died on the way. Jang Geum then trained to be a Medical Lady, because it was the only way a slave-servant can enter the palace. After much work, Jang Geum manages to re-enter the palace and meet up with her old friends. But when Choi Sang Goong and her gang find out, they try in vain to drive Jang Geum out. During the time Jang Geum was a Medical Lady, she contributed much, and in recognition of her work, King Jungjong bestowed on her an official title. She was the first and last woman to gain an official title and be the King's principal physician. However, in the end, she chose the path of a commoner. Waaaaaaa.......I wish she didn't.<br /><br />Leaves you wanting more, doesn't it?

"Tomorrow the World", the play in which this picture is based, was popular on Broadway during the WWII era. It was to expect it made it to the movies. Ring Lardner Jr, one of the best American writers of the time undertook the film adaptation aided by Leopold Atlas. Leslie Fenton, the director made the best of it.<br /><br />An American family living in the midwest accept to house and care for a German youth whose father was friendly with the head of the household, Mike Frame, a widower, with a teen age daughter. <br /><br />When Emil Bruckner arrives, he immediately makes a blunder when he describes his plane trip seated next to a fat Jew. Well, little does this little brat know that Mike is seeing a school teacher who happens to be Jewish. Leona Richards is the epitome of kindness and patience. So is Pat, the daughter who tries to show Emil around and help him make friends in her circle. Emil does everything possible to destroy this family that welcomed him into their home. Little by little he tries to get his way until everybody finds out this little boy is a bully and a coward.<br /><br />The cast of this 1944 movie is headed by the great Frederic March, one of the icons of the American theater and the film industry. He plays the decent Mike Frame. Betty Field makes an impressive appearance as the kind Lee Richards. Agnes Moorehead, is also good as Aunt Jessie, who is charmed by the rotten Emil. Skip Homeier, repeating his theater role is remarkable as the young Nazi sympathizer who gets a lesson in how wrong he has been about his American hosts.<br /><br />This is a movie that has a dated look, but still makes an impression because of the strength of the treatment it received from the writers and the director.

i only watched jewel in the palace out of curiosity. it was highly advertised as "phenomenal" and "record breaking" in the Philippines. i watched the first few episodes and got interested enough but a rival show got my attention more.<br /><br />but my mom, dad and brother were hooked! it finally came to a point where my mom borrowed the disk set from a friend so she can catch up on the episodes she missed. well. they were there and i had nothing else to do so i watched it.<br /><br />I'm kinda young so i thought it most probably wouldn't float my boat. but surprisingly, i saw myself waking up day after day watching at least 3 episodes of Jewel in the palace.<br /><br />it was interesting cause no one ever dislikes watching prodigies at work. and that's what janggeum is.. it's just a plus that she's really pretty and has a good heart etc.<br /><br />seriously, if i watched this on TV it would've driven me crazy. good thing for DVDs! :D the universal appeal that it claims to have seems to be in the fact that it is entertaining, educating and practically without sex and violence. a few fist fights here and there and a truckload of back stabbings, schemings and conniving but not very much blood, gore and general things-that-would-make-your-kid-hit-other-kids.<br /><br />i haven't finished the entire series but because the TV show is ending here in the Philippines, i already know what's going to happen.<br /><br />it's a great show to learn from: cooking, medicines, values and standing up for what is right.. all that blah.<br /><br />apparently, it was well researched and is based on true events.. and who doesn't like that? dae jang geum was the first (and possibly only) personal physician to the king. and that was even after a few death threats and several frame ups. mostly, it's an inspirational story about not giving up<br /><br />"She is like wild grass. No matter how you pull it, that plant will return and return." -Geum-young

(Just finished the series in S.F./Oakland bay area channel 32 - KMTP (KMTP). On the 4th of July.) WOW! I was always reminding myself that she'll be OK, so calm down. (I looked up two sites to help me):<br /><br />1. The Chicago Korean Drama Fan Club at:<br /><br />http://deiner.proboards48.com/index.cgi?board=daejanggeum - excellent site!! <br /><br />2. http://hkadb.net/info/Jewel_In_The_Palace - details of each hour.<br /><br />The subtitles are fantastic and clear. The details of all the characters is again fantastic. The cooking and medicine details are amazing. Her adopted parents and friends are priceless. THE WHOLE SHOW IS FANTASTIC!!! <br /><br />Being 2006, I'm sure, I'm the last to find this "jewel" (sorry - could not resist) it did first come out in 2003. Hope more are as lucky as I am, and find this great series.

Jang-geum's story is engrossing, as other comments have noted, for all sorts of people. Very inspiring for its central moral drama, it is also full of great incidental historical and cultural information. The lead, Yeong-ae Lee, as Jang-geum, is a fine, subtle actress; here's hoping she will appear in more films. Since she apparently was part of the jury at 2006 Berlin Film Festival she should have a wider world cinema audience. Also, the English subtitles are exceptionally well done, but I regret that they don't give English language production information. Those writers, directors, producers and actors deserve to be honored. It is good that IMDb lets us fans research this, though. Thanks IMDb and commenters, too!

The very first time I first heard of this hit Korean drama here in my country was when it was reported that many in Hong Kong watched the finale and it broke the record in terms of viewership ratings there. From then on, it had got me intrigued.<br /><br />Based on the life of the first ever woman royal physician in the now Korea, it will definitely pull your heartstrings and move you. The age-old philosophy of perseverance and facing whatever adversaries no matter how big or small is dominant in this drama serial.<br /><br />Lee Young-Ae plays the role of Jang Geum very well. So do the other cast members as well. Those who play the evil court ladies are really so convincing that it made me forgot for a moment that it is only just a show.<br /><br />The spread of food being shown in the drama serial can really make you go mouth-watering. You will be surprised as to why each dish has its own significance and all that. The medical knowledge that Jang Geum has later on in the serial is really impressive but then at times, it got her into trouble as well. But she always persevered and save the day. The scenes with Lord Min are always very sweet and romantic.<br /><br />In this current age and times where the traits Jang Geum possesses really make people try to understand more of the world they are in, this show is definitely a winner. Virtually almost no sex is involved here and this is something Asian societies has been waiting for a long time, given our culture can be conservative at times. But as long as anyone is interested in checking out this drama serial, you need to find out first whether there's dubbing and/or subtitles involved if your local TV station is showing it. Chances are there will be, given the original language is in Korean. As I watched this drama serial through DVD, the dubbing and subtitles really helped me understand what is happening.<br /><br />After finishing watching this show, I understand why so many love it. I do too.

This is the first time I have written a comment on IMDb in all the years I have used it avidly to search for worthy videos to watch. I am writing it not because there is not enough comments already for this wonderful series, but to additionally help you decide if you should invest a whopping 54 hours of your life on watching one drama! Since this is aimed at convincing you why you should watch it, I will keep spoilers to a minimum.<br /><br />So how did I get involved with it? I was searching for worthy Korean TV series to watch after having seen the more contemporary setting drama such as Stairway To Heaven, which is highly recommended. When I came across this, although rated highly by others, I shy-ed away from it for the same reason above ... I just couldn't imagine how this kind of drama can entice me. But...someone I know asked if I have it to lent them due to the fact I told people I watched Korean Drams. I did not in spite of my collection of top DVD titles. I decided to get it just to find out what it was all about. At the time, IMDb did not have this title rated to assist in my decision.<br /><br />Episode one was interesting. Not hooked but enough interest to keep me going...same with the next one...and then when I finally got to the part when the little Jang Geum became orphaned and out-shone the other little girls in the palace in her determination and diligence, that is when I really got hooked, which brings me to a suggestion ... watch the first 3 episodes in their entirety. If you are still only on the sideline not sure to continue or not after watching episode 3, then you should probably stop watching (really unthinkable to me but I suppose it is possible). The actors/actresses are handsome/pretty, but that is not why I continued.<br /><br />The first set of DVDs I purchased was made in China and had OK English translation. The problem with the English translation, while subtle, surfaced more in the second half, as one can tell they are not done by the same person(s). An anal movie-buff that I am, I sold it and bought the YesAsia edition, more expensive but has much better translation (a very prominent example would be: Palace Girl in the China Edition is Court Lady in the YesAsia edition -- while Palace Girl is the "literal" translation, the proper equivalent by title is Court Lady). The picture quality is also better. In fact, my wife commented that Jang-Geum (grown up) is not as pretty as in the China version now that she can see the imperfections on her face close up.... So I ended up spending yet another 54 hours re-watching...but it was worth it...because the translation clarified things that otherwise would have been lost as "cultural differences." This is the set that will remain in my library as one of the rare "worthy" TV dramas to collect in its original form. By the way, the China edition in the green box has bonus materials of interview with some of the cast members as well as the last 7 days of filming -- even though there is no English subtitle on the bonus materials, it was still quite enjoyable to see how the cast looked in "modern" attire and their reaction to the questions! :)<br /><br />With so many TV programs trying to "buy" an audience with "sex, violence, and improper language (lack of respect)" screen time nowadays, it is truly refreshing to see something that not only serves to entertain but also educate at the same time without emphasis on sex and violence! It is little wonder that this series has swept away audiences all over and realigned some of the younger generation to the ideals that seem to be eroding away in the modern world.<br /><br />In closing, none of the episodes disappointed and they were all enjoyable, but it is just a small few minutes here and there of extra details that seem to drag a bit in the first 10 episodes. In fact, I have a feeling that if you are KOREAN you will probably not feel the drag due to your ability to relate those details better than non-KOREANs like me.<br /><br />The quality of research that has gone into making this production (the cuisines and the medicines) is impressive and educational. The music - excellent. Combined with the singular vision of one director and one writer for this drama, it is a COMPLETE experience that, in short, will enrich the lives of anyone who is open-minded and willing to invest the time to watch it.<br /><br />Please let me know if my comment is helpful to you.

A detective (Richard Conte) goes undercover, posing as an intern at New York's Bellevue Hospital, in order to solve the murder of another intern. What he discovers is a rather sophisticated operation of gambling and drug dealing. Desperate interns, a seductive and crooked ward nurse played by Colleen Grey, and a rather demented hospital maintenance man (Pops) played by Richard Tabor, together call into question the very integrity of the famous hospital. Conte works his way through to solve the murder and to learn the circumstances around it in some unusual film noir settings amidst darkened hospital wards and empty hallways.

A bleak, atmospheric movie, filmed entirely on location at New York's Bellevue Hospital. Fine performances by Conte, Gray, Alexander and a slew of New York stage actors. Note the brief but significant appearance, at the beginning of the movie, by Hugh Reilly, who went on to star in the Lassie TV series.

Two well-known titles in the noir cycle are The City That Never Sleeps (1953) and While The City Sleeps (1956). Before them, there was the less familiar The Sleeping City. In this last (or first), what seems asleep is not so much New York as a city-within-a-city  the huge old fortress of Bellevue Hospital, where, at night in its wards and among its staff, skulduggery is afoot. Bellvue opened its doors to the film's cast and crew, perhaps not wholly grasping that the resulting portrait might be less than reassuring to prospective patients. But it's not a story, at least explicitly, about malpractice. <br /><br />A jumpy, distracted intern on his break goes outside to grab a smoke. He ends up with a bullet through his brain. Since the murder appears to be an inside job, an undercover department of the city police plants a detective (Richard Conte) in the hospital among the interns. He's had some medical training in the army and so should pass casual muster. Taking lodging in the building and going on rounds, he makes acquaintances. Among them are his bitter roommate, Alex Nichol, nursing some resentments about not being rich, either by birth or through wedlock; ward nurse Coleen Gray, raising a young son from an unhappy first marriage; and chummy elevator operator Richard Taber, who bunks down off the boiler room  where he runs a book where the cash-strapped interns can play the ponies. <br /><br />What Conte's after is not just the killer but the source of an infectious but non-microbial malaise that will claim Nichol, too, the night before he was to marry. Conte finds himself the prime suspect in his roommate's death and comes close to blowing his cover before his own superiors intervene. But Conte's suspicions about Taber's bookmaking operation aren't quite on the mark; it turns out that a 'white-stuff job' is the real racket....<br /><br />Light and portable equipment developed during World War II made location shooting finally feasible, and the low-budget second-features in the post-war years pioneered its use. The Sleeping City affects a pseudo-documentary style that also came into vogue as a complement to the new cinema-verité look (a chase through the bowels of the massive institution stays particularly sinister). Despite a nifty shot of the new interns descending an endless stairwell en masse, the vast hospital looks underpopulated, especially during the graveyard shift. But the claustrophobia (the whole picture is shot in and around the hospital) pays off. The main characters aren't many, but not so few that they can't deliver a final twist.

This movie is complete garbage. I didn't think it was funny or anything. I could find no redeeming value in this movie at all. Do you think it would be okay for someone to make a movie about a child molester killing kids and raping them? Neither do I, and I also don't think it is okay for them to make a movie where the killer does this to women. When is the world going to wake and realize that this kind of stuff is not okay? <br /><br />This movie supposedly won awards. So did Eminem, the guy who sings about raping his 10 year old sister. Well, I think it is very misogynistic and Hastings should not be carrying this kind of movie. Next time I'll be renting at Blockbuster.

Thats not a joke, If you like this movie you are not safe in your own company. Don't wait call the doctor now, 72 hour evaluation might seem painful but the sooner you get it over with the sooner you can get on with your life which is probably not worth getting on with at this point so you can start a new one. Seriously, if you like this movie you are heading for trouble, there is help. You know what happens to mu-dd at the end, don't be that guy. The term of use on this site are really stupid, I've said every thing there is to say about this movie and I have to keep typing until I reach ten lines to post it. Also it thinks mu-dd is a spelling error, That is a guys name Idiot robot. almost finished, lucky sucks. and so does this site, we cant even emphasise things with capitol lettering? Gayness!

One must make allowances -- it was wartime, it was propaganda, it was United Artists -- but even taking all that into account, this is a fairly ludicrous melodrama about an upper-middle-class American household that brings chaos on itself by unknowingly inviting a Hitler Youth into its home. And what a little hellraiser he turns out to be -- writing anti-Semitic epithets about his teacher and potential stepmom (Field), whacking his cousin(Carroll) with a fireplace iron, attempting to knife a playmate. Adapted by no less than Ring Lardner Jr. from a hit Broadway play, it may have had resonance at the time, if audiences were willing to overlook pedestrian direction, absurdly melodramatic music, and Homeier's undisciplined histrionics (reprising his stage role, he's sort of a Nazi Dennis the Menace). But the script, like so many at the time, takes the goodness of Americans, all Americans, so for granted that it starts to sound smug and patronizing. (It's a mighty white-bread America they're portraying, too; if that's how things really were, it looks today like an unwitting expose of America's racist past.) It also suggests that it's fairly easy to deprogram these little monsters; all it takes is a bit of lovingkindness and a birthday present. March and Moorehead (playing a repressed spinster aunt, much like she did in "The Magnificent Ambersons") were as good as movie actors get, but they're playing devices here, not flesh and blood. Under the circumstances, Betty Field manages to be surprisingly interesting -- she always looks so worried, like she has a horrible secret the audience never finds out.

Here it is. Out the thousands of movies I've seen over the decades, this one BITES. I could always find something to like about every movie, but this one is totally disturbed. A bad writer in a bad situation makes some bad decisions with bad results and creates more bad situations that snowball into more bad situations with bad dialogue and bad filming and bad screenplay. The dog is bad, even before it dies. The characters are bad. The music is bad. The smell of the DVD is bad. The art work is bad. There is no suspense. The gore is bad. The special effects are bad. I had to take some Pepto in the middle of the movie, but like a trooper I choked the entire movie down. That night I even had a bad dream about the movie. Guinness Book is looking at this one right now as the worlds badest of the bad.

This movie must be viewed with an open mind - realizing it is a spoof, I believe - and not to be taken seriously. Carrie Barton (as Sadie Pray) in the blonde wig was just too funny and completely looked different than her pix on this website. I believed her and wanted to see more of her. Even though Carrie's part was small, she continued to be impressive with her subtle portrayal of a character difficult to portray, in that it was a character that could easily be "overdone." While the movie does have some disturbing scenes, overall those scenes were not so objectionable that I turned away. It was funny. I look forward to following her career planned for the future.

I saw this at NYC Horror Film Festival and was shocked to read that it won for best feature!!! This film was boring and lackluster and by no means was compelling. I do not see why it is labeled as a horror film. Maybe because it is horrific.

I saw this at the San Francisco independent film festival, and it was totally contrived and boring. It was intended to shock the audience, I was just shocked on how slow and unimaginative this supposively innovative movie was. I won't give it away, but will only say that you will be disappointed if you decide to watch the whole movie through. It certainly does not get better as it drags on.

Well...i rented this movie only because i needed a second movie to rent at the video store and this one promised a dollar back if returned the next day...now i know why..they knew no one would want to keep this poor excuse of a movie in their house for more then a day. I believe it actually lowered my intelligence. The funny thing is, the main character rambles on as if he is supposed to be intelligent with a bunch of 50 cent words at best...and funny enough the only reason i rented this movie was the fact that the box description claimed a dog<which looked a little like the taco bell dog with a mohawk with an african american accent> actually talked, and told him things to do...well the dog never physically talks, it just talks TELEKENETICALLY...i would tell you more..but half way through the film my eyes began to close as well did my fiances...so at least this movie serves as a sleep aid...That sadly however is its only purpose. Please dont do like i normally do and rent the movie despite the bad review, when i say this movie sucks worse then having a dog p*ss on the leg of your best dress slacks...i mean it!!

Wow! Attended a local film festival where they were showcasing horror / sci-fi films. This definitely caught our eye being the basis about a talking dog and how it drives his owner to kill. After the film, my friends and I were shocked and disturbed but we were so enthralled that we can't stop talking about it. This is one pet you don't want to forget to walk or feed!

I happened to be one of the few, very fortunate people to see this at a recent screening during the "first annual" NYC (Independent) Horror Film Festival, and let me tell you, it was a real treat! It was far and away the favourite-of-show (winning Best in Show by the judging panel, and - ballot tabulation not having been posted, I can only guess, but probably - audience favourite as well). Pray that some distributor has the good sense to overlook its idiosyncratic, non-mainstream nature and recognise it as must-see cinema. This is one hard film to describe without ruining surprises or giving away too much. The writer, Stephen Sustarsic, has done a great job of summarising it without including spoilers, so I will try to give you a feel for the movie instead of a synopsis. In Hollywood Speak, it would be The Secret Life of Walter Mitty meets Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, with dashes of Amelie and Twin Falls, Idaho (and possibly Crumb) thrown in for flavour. But it is definitely much more than the sum of its filmic predecessor parts. First and foremost, it has a loopy, loony, don't-take-me-too-seriously quality, augmented by the music (one almost expects an accordion from some French cafe to be playing in the background, as in Delicatessen or Amelie, but it's a bit more restrained than that), which absolutely belies the seriousness of what's actually taking place. But it is this deludedly, deceptively droll approach which helps take the audience by the hand and lead them willingly along to the abhorrent shocks that await.<br /><br />It also has similarities with films like Eraserhead - NOT the dreadfully slow pacing, but the way in which it takes an absolutely pedestrian look at a life filled with increasingly bizarre occurrences. Again, it is this dichotomy of style and substance - the absurdist, banal storytelling method used to describe horrific atrocities - which helps the audience accept and even welcome each new level of insanity that develops as the film progresses. This dichotomy is even further augmented by the casting. You have all seen the lead, Michael Emanuel; he is perhaps most recognisable as the guy who "lowered his cholesterol" in those ubiquitous TV commercials (and was also the husband in the McDonald's commercial in which the son gets the mother and father to believe each wants to take the other out to dinner by way of apology). He is the absolute, quintessential Everyman, the down-on-his-luck, wouldn't-hurt-a-fly kind of guy you wouldn't look twice at on the street. He is so normal, and so much the secret us, the part of us that "knows" we're doomed to failure and mediocrity, that you can't help rooting for him when he begins to succeed, no matter what the cost. And it is our belief in and acceptance of him as our own most prosaic self that helps us exonerate his actions and empathise with his plight.<br /><br />This isn't exactly entirely new territory, nor is it mind-bendingly innovative or inventive. Certainly there have been dozens of other films to explore ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, as well as the nature of sanity, the dual-edged sword of creativity, and the ways in which perception is more real than "reality." There are even numerous directors who have taken similar approaches to the story telling found in Lucky - Jean-Pierre Jeunot, the Cohen brothers, and Woody Allen (in their darkest periods) all come to mind. But this is good company to be in. And it has a smallness, a personability and charm to it, that makes you feel as if you've discovered the movie yourself, and want rush out and tell your friends, as I am trying to do here. So if you like absurdist serio-comedy with a sting to it, please, please, please be on the lookout for this movie, see it, and support it the best you can. You won't be disappointed!

Millard Mudd is a down on his luck cartoon writer whose fortunes change with the arrival of a cute little dog named Lucky. Murder and mayhem ensue.<br /><br />Lucky is not a good movie - it's too wordy, the "hero" is completely unlikeable, and the pacing is off. But it's filled with more disturbing stuff than most movies: necrophilia, sex torture, and chainsaws among them. Plus it really seems to hate women. SIDEBAR: I'm a chick horror fan and get really upset when people point to horror flicks as nothing but misogyny. But this movie really doesn't like women.<br /><br />It kept me watching right up to the dumb ending because I had to see where it was going. Has some darkly funny moments but nothing special. No animal cruelty though - the car wreck that introduces Lucky excepted.<br /><br />Best Line: "Perception is nine tenths of the law."

To be humorous on a low budget feature is often a very difficult task. To blend humor and horror is an even more arduous task. But director Steve Cuden does so with such imagination and creativity. With a feature that can best be described as daring, Cuden has created a jet black comedy that will chill you. With great performances and a distinct visual style, this hybrid film will thoroughly entertain and sit up and beg for repeat viewings. Definitely, check this film out!

The story is a bit cold-blooded, but the dialog between Millard the mediocre writer and Lucky the demonic dog is some of the wittiest ever you'll hear in American film. And the sparkling cast does the dialog justice. A minor morbid gem along the lines of "Eating Raul" and "The Honeymoon Killers." <br /><br />The writer, Stephen Sustarsic, have a long and extensive background in television sitcoms, but here he seems to have let his unbridled id indulge in the sort of Rabelasian humor that the networks would NEVER allow. As it is, this movie's take on every writer's nightmare when facing creative paralysis cuts a lot deeper than anything Stephen King has managed.

"Tomorrow the World" is a thought provoking film about an American family who adopts a troubled German boy after the war. Together they try to undo the ridgid Nazi influence that was instilled in him (which is no easy feat). Leslie Fenton directs a first rate cast including Fredric March, Betty Field, Agnes Moorehead and Joan Carroll. However it is Skip Homeier as the Nazi youth who steals the picture with an electrifying performance. The film is available on video and DVD.

This remake of Ivanhoe suffers from several things: changes in the story line, incongruities in the historical aspects of the period and Anthony Andrews's inability to portray anything beyond a prig middle class playboy. Good performances by Sam Neill, James Mason and Olivia Hussey can't save it. The costumes are fine but Andrew's wincing and facial contortions along with John Rhys-Davies's over-acting and emoting ruin it. Too bad. This one had potential. Hey, if you want a costume drama fix, go see the 1952 Robert Taylor and Liz Taylor version: it's much more satisfying.

Yes, it does "period" in the same broad sweeping comic-book gestures as the Hollywood of yesteryear. Yes, saying Sam Neil is over-acting in this one is like calling Lassie merely a good dog. Yes, we've so done the hero-who-actually-IS-a-good-guy bit. Yes, the overly French-Horned theme reminds me of the satirically self-important music from Young Frankenstein. It is cheesy, yes! But you start out with a classic romp of a tale that happens to (as a little bonus) dig a little deeper and discuss some pretty important stuff. And  my god  Olivia Hussey was a babe.<br /><br />And what is really great is that as this book was written, your interest doesn't have to be maintained by the titular character because there are supporting folks heavy-laden with their own fascinating tales  and that's the way this movie was cast; the most interesting actors are playing the most interesting characters.<br /><br />And Robin Hood is in it. That just rocks.

Every new years day 14:10pm it's tradition that our whole family sits down in front of the TV and watch Ivanhoe. I just love this classic film of knights and virgins. The story is beautiful and the fights is great. it's a real treat if you are like me a fan of medieval story's. A fun scene i never will forget is when Robin Hoods priest Tuck punch king Richard the Lionheart right in the mouth, not knowing who he is. A great moment for me was when i in a Dungeuns and dragon game meeting stole Sam Neils Line after i was challenged by another knight. "Prepare your self then. Look the last upon the sun!" If you like Anthony Andrews as Wilfred of Ivanhoe i recommend his Other TV movie The Scarlet Pimpanel.

Courage, revenge, love, combat, victory, honor, defense, reconciliation...those ideals deeply hidden within the human spirit have long been considered precious targets of human life. Not only poetry and literature but also epic movies attempted to promote the virtues and depict humanity in the spirit of reason and heart. The question was: historical time. In this respect, there was, perhaps, no better period in history than the 1,000 year-long Middle Ages, both controversial and spiritual with a flair for darkness and exceptional enlightenment. Among many other epic movies that depict the period is IVANHOE based on Sir Walter Scott's novel being at the same time a remake of the 1952 classic Hollywood production.<br /><br />Keeping in mind that remakes usually face high expectations in case of their classic "predecessors", I watched this movie without much referring to the older version and that is how I intend to comment on it underneath.<br /><br />Let me say at the beginning that IVANHOE by Douglas Camfield is a very good movie at multiple levels. It makes a perfect use of historical material supplying us with a clear and pretty accurate insight into Medieval England, and, more specifically, its late 12th century situation with savage conflicts, difficult political situation, Anglo-Saxons vs Normans relations, prejudice as well as those visual aspects like costumes, feasts and baths. In this respect, the movie may constitute for a viewer a wonderful journey into those distant times and bring out some pearls out of prefabricated negative opinions about the Middle Ages. There was, indeed, something good about the period, too. The aspect of interest highlighted in this case appears to be Ashbey sequence where the savage combines with the glamorous or the deep psychology and morals of characters expressed in many scenes throughout. Here, it seems necessary to mention Lady Rowena (Lysette Anthony) and Rebecca (Olivia Hussey), two women of different backgrounds who face similar emotions.<br /><br />Besides, IVANHOE can boast very good cinematography, wonderful shots, stunning locations. Consider, for instance, the subtle images at the scene when Ivanhoe visits Lady Rowena at her castle with Wamba (George Innes). The extraordinary locations and interesting shots make the film not only a historical work but also a rousing adventure. Moreover, to these artistic features, I would add a very accurate sense of humor (consider the scene of a bath or Wamba's Pax Vobiscum) and subtle musical score. The tunes are filled with the spirit of chivalry and the spirit of romance which, alone, can resemble the very essence of the story. But, the core of art is acting.<br /><br />The movie known for a number of famous and talented cast could be falsely assessed as a vehicle. Yet, it does not have to be a "promotion" for anybody. To the contrary, it is a film that proves the importance of talent first and foremost. All the cast take great pains to give something truly great of themselves. Anthony Andrews is a perfect Ivanhoe as described by Sir Scott and as imagined by modern viewers. He clearly portrays a character of courage, nobility and gentleness. Sam Neill and John Rhys Davies appear to give powerful performances as "Norman dogs" people not so much afraid for the good but rather absorbed by savage brutality. James Mason does a fine job as calm, good Jew, Isaac of York, whose destiny appears to have brought more wounds than cure. The female roles are brilliant. Here, however, I would not praise that much Lysette Anthony: I admit she is beautiful, she gives a memorable performance. Yet, the absolute top notch is Olivia Hussey, the famous heroine at Zeffirelli's appears here as a gentle, subtle, beautiful Jewess whose "individually formed spirituality" conquers "externally organized morality" of many "pious men of God." She gives a brilliant performance as a flower of peace fearfully surrounded by the thorn of war and the light of tolerance surrounded by the darkness of prejudice. Absolutely great role! Consider, among many, the scenes depicting the trial.<br /><br />In the end, if you see this IVANHOE, do not compare it with the older version. These are two different films focusing on different aspects. If someone insists on me to say which one is better, I'd rather say both are good films. Thorpe's IVANHOE is a typical epic of the classic Hollywood era while Camfield's IVANHOE stands out on its own as a movie filled with remarkable psychology and adventure. Great tribute to the real Courage and the Chivalrous Spirit!

As a classic storytale it has it all. A great plot, characters you fall in love with, evil bad guys etc But the film has aged well as a drama also, I reckon now way later... The cast is excellent. Top quality actors all over the place. And Olivia Hussey in this role, breaks my heart every time. I'd say this is one of those classic films that you can watch as a kid, with your parents and their parents and you will all enjoy it (for the same or different reasons) It is a crying shame if it's not available on DVD. My VHS copy is falling apart, but I'm lucky since Swedish National Television airs Ivanhoe every Christmas....

I must admit I've always liked this one. There are many reasons, but the chief one is the cast, which is brilliant in all parts.<br /><br />Playing a hero, especially a naïve goody-two-shoes one, is probably the most difficult job in show business (just ask anyone who's played Batman) but he solves it very well, and sometimes annoyingly so (when he remains faithful to the beautiful, but dull, Rowena (also well-payed by Anthony, who does the best she can with Rowena).<br /><br />From a post modern, jaded opinion, the more interesting characters are the three villains; the egocentric Front de Beuf (Rhys Davies), the amoral Maurice the Bracy (Stuart Wilson) and the cunning Brian de Bois Guilbert (Sam Neill). Also, the wise Rebecca (Olivia Hussey), the bitter Isaac (James Mason) and the stubborn Cedric (Michael Hordern) are good, and even Wamba and Robin Hood. In fact, while the book/film is called "Ivanhoe", the interesting parts are the dynamics between Brian Guilbert and Rebecca, or between James Mason and John Rhys-Davies (classic!).<br /><br />Summing up: The film portrays Medieval England as both civilized and savage, and the castles and costumes are plausible rather than costly. The film has an epic battle scene, as well as really good jousting, intelligent conversation and interesting character development. It's definitely worth watching.

"Ivanhoe" is one of the best historical movies I've ever seen! I would recommend this to anybody because it's full of romance and adventure. I didn't like the ending though, only because Sam Neill's character didn't end up with Rebecca (Olivia Hussey), which was really sad. <br /><br />I don't know what else to say besides the fact that I fell in love with this movie after I saw it the first time. But the fact that they portrayed Rowena as the beautiful girl that everybody was supposed to like was kinda depressing. Between Rebecca and Rowena, I think Rebecca stole the movie because of her courage and will to help Ivanhoe even though they have different backgrounds. So if you have read this, go out and buy the video.

We watched this movie in school. We also watched Spartacus. I definitely prefer Ivanhoe to Spartacus. I think that Ivanhoe was more interesting with all of the jousting. Though, as I was watching it I kept thinking of "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" by Mel Brooks. "Its King Richard back from the Crusades" Though at the end of the film, our teacher take a vote and the boys thought that Ivanhoe should choose Rowena and the girls wanted Ivanhoe to choose Rebecca!Overall I really liked this movie. I really want to read the book now. Though some parts are boring. The jousting is wicked cool though. If Sir William Scott was still alive, I think that he would of been very proud.

I guess all countries have a few strange traditions and this film is connected to one of ours in Sweden. Every New Year´s Day the last twenty years public service television have showned this movie in the afternoon, the perfect time for dragging yourself up, buying a pizza and maybe forget your extreme hangover for a while. Everyone knows the film inside out but are still watching it year after year; fills in on every funny line (like when de Boeuf shouts "Striiip him!"), laughs once again over great characters like Athelstone and Tuck and gets annoyed over how Ivanhoe can choose the boring Lady Rowena before foxy Olivia Hussey. I can´t really say anymore if it´s a good movie or not but I guess it´s perfect for a day after...

Ivanhoe: A nice experience for a romantic fan<br /><br />This was a TV-movie I liked when I was a child, I still think it is okay, but maybe not a realistic end battle between Brian and Wilfred, and the same with the make up, some of the costumes and hair styles. But you will find a lot of good joustings between the knights. Some of the actors are better than average, I liked Sam Neill as Brian de bois Builbert and James Mason as Isac of York.<br /><br />Rating: 7 of 10.

I had not heard of the film until I saw it on the Turner Movie Classics schedule. Seeing the subject matter and the 1944 date excited me. The writer, director and cast would be playing out the issues in real time, as the die was cast. I grew up in a household conflicted with stories and opinions of Nazi Germany. My mother is Jewish. My father was German and raised by a father who supported Hitler. I have always been fascinated by Germans who seem to be good people who choose to ignore the eventual outcome of Hitler's madness and defend Germany's need for him.<br /><br />The characters each have their unique perspective and reaction to Emil as played masterfully by Skip Homeier. The desire to see only the good in a human being with no expectation that they are dealing with a fully brainwashed evil acting thug is such an American trait. This movie is simply made and concentrates closely on the story, and it's the story and the acting that is compelling. I think you will enjoy it if you enjoy a good psychological study. My husband was disappointed with the ending, I, however, was overjoyed and cried. P. S. It was nice to see Agnes Moorehead in her role. I have never seen her play such a "normal person".

Just like in " Romeo and Juliet " Olivia Hussey takes place in front of us. She makes all the difference. An extraordinary actress with a very special beauty takes this classical movie and place it very, very high...<br /><br />The music, the scenery- and the acting... It all ends up in this beautiful movie. Sadness. Frustration and a lot of love.<br /><br />You got to love it...

This is one of my favorite movies of all times. And the best version of Scott's tale as of yet. A+ for the professional and highly convincing cast, the costumes, the beautiful scenery, and the 'rich' plot. A good drama, a great epic, and a romance in times of chivalry and honor (i.e., in extinct times!).<br /><br />

If you have the chance, catch this splendid Ivanhoe remake on the tube or on VHS (it is a crying shame that this doesn't come on DVD, Amazon). It punches several well deserved holes in the tedious, pompous and dire 1952 version with the two Taylors, each performing worse than the other. Come on, Robert Taylor as Ivanhoe?? The 1952 film is clearly a case of a movie being made at the wrong time in Hollywood history.<br /><br />Anyone questioning the acting capabilities of Anthony Andrews clearly hasn't seen Brideshead Revisited. He is a great, believable, and may I add, gorgeous Ivanhoe.<br /><br />The film boasts a great, thought provoking script (which granted does take some liberties with the source material although much of the lovely dialog from Scott's book has found its way into the film), great performances (especialy by Neill, Mason and Hussey and the incomparable George Innes as Wamba) as well as beautiful production values and photography.<br /><br />And, as an added bonus, it is a virtual babe fest (Wilson, Neill and Andrews are all at their physical prime here)!

Pride and prejudice, betrayal and revenge, lust and purity, kidnappings, tournaments, and ransoms... what better ingredients could be assembled in one film? This retelling of Ivanhoe has many exceptional qualities, including first-rate cinematography and chivalric music. But the quality of this Ivanhoe lies in the casting. James Mason plays an excellent Isaac of York, and Olivia Hussey's Rebecca is every bit as passionate as Elizabeth Taylor's. Lysette Anthony has all the ingenue quality of a Saxon princess; yet one wonders whom Ivanhoe would have chosen to marry if race and religious prejudices had not been the order of the day. One of the strengths of this film was, to my mind, the triumvirate of villains Bois-Guilbert, de Bracy, and Front de Boeuf. Sam Neill is brilliant as the knight torn between his order and his obsession with a "Jewess heathen", and Stuart Wilson shines in the supporting role of the besotted de Bracy. This film was released on video at one point, as I rented it from a video store. I highly recommend it.

I saw it when it was first broadcast--and some of it again when rerun a year or two later. It made me very squidgy. The principals and producers weren't really comfortable with the material and it showed. The only thread of the story that was credible was Hope Lange's distress at having her son (or adopted son?) suddenly find out about his father's (or adoptive father's?) live-in boyfriend. <br /><br />Scott Jacoby was horrendously miscast. The only way Hope Lange and Hal Holbrook could have had this ugly, obnoxious kid was to have taken in the child of some (unrelated) friends. Perhaps the other couple got killed in an auto accident--who knows? Anyway, it would make sense for Hal and Hope not to have had any kids of their own, so this created a whole new backstory that was not explicitly dealt with in the script. Here they were stuck with this pushy brat, and bending over backwards to be nice to him and smooth over his ruffled feelings, and they always got bupkis for their trouble. <br /><br />The pivotal scene was Martin Sheen bringing out the birthday cake ('but it's noawt moy boitday!' kvetches the brat) and then Sheen has to swallow endless abuse and innuendo from the little creep, who (let's face it) knew the score from the moment he saw his 'father' living in the same house with this other guy. This is another example of disjuncture between the actual script and the story as portrayed: the Scott Jacoby character is an up-to-date, crudely aware little wiseguy, but the director and adult actors are going around pretending he's this delicate flower who's had a sheltered life. I imagine that the kid was a past-master at subtle psychological blackmail. This new 'revelation' just gives him more ammunition. His poor adoptive parents! <br /><br />And the moral is: Don't adopt a kid who's obviously not yours. You'll get no thanks!

I don't know if I would still think this movie was worth 8 or not. I have tried to find it for years, to view it as an adult and see if I would like it as much! I can't imagine how it was stuck into anybodies lineup. The letters must have come pouring in from all the far right fundamentalists! It seemed to be a TV movie way ahead of the pack with it's sensitive angle, from son's perspective. Nobody was a bad guy. I was following Scott Jacoby's career at the time and thought he did a great job! While portraying homosexuals was a brave career move (back then) for both Hal and Martin, I thought Scott stole the show! I think this may have been the best thing he did as an actor.

That Certain Summer is way ahead of it's time for the year 1972.I did not see the movie when it originally aired in 1972. I had not even heard of the movie until I received this movie on VHS tape from a collector.I watched it a couple of nights ago, and I was amazed at the subject matter for the year 1972.First off, the cast was excellent. Hal Holbrook, Hope Lange, Martin Sheen, and Scott Jacoby were just right for their roles.The scenery and setting of San Francisco added to the film's atmosphere.What I like best about the movie is the way that the story ended. The ending did not produce any certain answers for the family involved.The viewer can decide whether the family will make it through the heartache and hurt that all of them are experiencing.This movie was very well done,and is very tender and touching.I recommend this movie very much.I have this movie.

I saw this at the Museum of Radio and Television (don't think it's available on DVD). I had first seen it as what now called a "questioning" young man in 1972 (the son's character was 14, I was 13 at the time) and remembered it being very important to me as the first sensitive, non- judgmental portrayal of gay men on television. I particularly remembered the poise of a very young Martin Sheen. Viewing it again after 35 years it was almost as affecting, with wonderful acting by a very strong ensemble cast, with Hope Lange a stand-out as the mother/ex-wife. I enjoyed the early-70s touches (shag carpeting in the bathroom, 8-track cassettes) but realized that -- despite so many advances in gay rights over the years -- it could almost be re-made today and still make sense. Cross your fingers that this someday is available on DVD.

I am reminded of this serious 1972 TV movie as a result of the newly released film, Brokeback Mountain. I was only 18 at the time, but the Holbrook/Sheen/Lange movie stayed with me for all these years. I think I still have a crush on Martin Sheen in his turtleneck sweater. All three leads in the movie did an excellent job. The movie seemed so serious and rather dark at the time. I just wish we could have talked more about the subject matter back then. It was one of those TV movies that just "disappeared" from site or discussion group comments. (Thank goodness for VHS and DVDs!) I am not aware of any reruns of this movie...ever. I'm sure someone will use it in a documentary some day.

That Certain Summer must have been ground breaking for a 1972 audience. Today I saw the film for the first time, and am duly impressed. Too bad it's not available for sale on DVD, or video. Well done stories about homosexuality are difficult to find. This one is well worth seeing! As That Certain Summer was done before the intrusion of AIDS, the film can only focus on homosexuality itself, not on the complexities of gay people reacting to crisis. <br /><br />Fortunately LOGO is showing That Certain Summer, and other similarly good films. That Certain Summer is comparable to the qualities found in Long Time Companion, and As Is. <br /><br />I recommend it!

I caught this bad boy at a showing in a Tulsa Oklahoma theater. The title made me think I was getting in for a cheesefest. Conrad Brooks is in it too so it has to be REALLY bad doesn't it? Well, no. See what makes this flick stand out is that it's far different from anything else I've seen. It's not Romero that's for sure. Think Romero with a little Lloyd Kaufman with a little Larry Cohen. I sat through the entire film and was not bored. That does not happen very often. At one point things in the film are happening so fast it felt chaotic and that's exactly what I'd imagine the filmmakers wanted you to feel. They wanted you to actually get in the movie. Now I don't want to sound like I'm totally praising the film because it's not THAT good but it's not bad either. It's one of those low budget shot on video horror films so how can you go in expecting much? Then we've got the title and the fact Conrad Brooks and Joe Estevez are in it. How can you expect much? What you can expect is a good time. I think anyone who actually knows this convention like list of horror stars will have an absolute blast. If you're looking for A grade acting with an incredible beautiful story go rent Hamlet. If you're looking for a nasty good time rent Zombiegeddon.

<br /><br />"That Certain Summer" was more than just one of 1972's best productions made expressly for television. It was an outstanding presentation by any standard and for any medium. The entire cast, crew, and production team worked in fine ensemble fashion to create a memorable and significant achievement. This deserves to be revived and widely offered on video.

Well-made TV-movie, largely acknowledged as the first made-for-television film to tackle the subject of homosexuality, has divorced San Francisco contractor Hal Holbrook looking forward to a visit from his fourteen-year-old son who lives out in Los Angeles with his mother; things are shaky when the kid meets his dad's new male friend, and once he figures out that Pop enjoys this male companion more so than eligible women, he runs away in anger and confusion. Levinson/Link production won raves upon its first network showing, and indeed it is smart, focused, and without stereotypes. Still, when the kid runs away (for a large section of the film), precious time on the clock is wasted as the adults search for him and worry. The film isn't melodramatic, thankfully; it's brave, it has a thoughtful, melancholy undermining, and the gay theme is served well (only some of the dialogue dates it). But more courageous the whole thing might have been with more hearty talk and less shame and tears.

Hal Holbrook is excellent. Martin Sheen is excellent. The story line is very touching. Hal Holbrook's son does not know his father is gay when he first comes for his annual summer visit. His live in lover, Martin Sheen, moves out during the visit and moves in with his very liberal minded sister and brother-in-law. One of the most memorable exchanges for me, takes place between Martin Sheen and his sister when she tells him how much she understands his lifestyle. His response is unexpected but very right on! The son learns accidently about his father and runs away but befriends a cablecar operator who helps him sort things out. Hope Lange is the perfect ex-wife. Great movie. I wish ABC would re-release it!

Avoid this movie at all costs, everything about it is bad, especially the ending which is almost comical.<br /><br />Here's a hint to American film makers who want to make a movie about the world of the gambler. Gambling is legal in many countries, in fact betting (bookie) shops were legalized in the UK in 1961 ! This means that to many audiences the whole notion of the penniless gambler running away from a bookie who wants to break his legs is just an archaic stereotype.<br /><br />The gambling world should be a fountain of stories for movie makers to film. Instead we normally get the dumb and dumbered down type of nonsense that Player 5150 represents.

First off, I never take the time to actually write a review of any of the movies I have seen, but I felt the need to do so to prevent others from having to waste their time with this film. I must admit that the fact that this went straight to DVD and starred Bob Sapp should have clued me in to the fact that this movie was less than stellar, but I went against my better judgment and watched it anyway. I am actually a bit embarrassed to admit that I was actually looking forward to seeing this since I tend to like movies that deal with plot lines centered on investing/stock trading (of which there was very little in this movie) and gambling (the main focus).<br /><br />The acting in this movie was terrible and it was painfully obvious that this was a pretty low budget film. There were a few somewhat notable actors in this film though which causes me to wonder what they were thinking since there is no way this job landed them a big, fat paycheck. Granted, Ethan Embry isn't exactly the first name off of a casting director's lips when discussing a potential lead for a huge blockbuster, but his talent surely merits him better work opportunities than this.<br /><br />If you choose to watch this movie despite the numerous red flags it has (straight to DVD, low budget, K-1 fighters attempting to act, etc.), seek solace in the fact that you will not waste too much of your time. The one redeeming quality that this movie had was the fact that it clocked in at just under an hour and a half. So, after you shake your head in disbelief at the ridiculous ending, you can at least look at the clock and thank the editors of this film for the fact that they could have wasted even more of your time.<br /><br />Proceed with caution.

Player 5150 is a great film for the authenticity it brings to screen. A rare gem in the rough. By comparison to all the special-effect driven overblown budged movies being released today, Player 5150 is a character-driven story that takes you through every range of emotion. David O'Neill (Writer/Director) does a great job inviting you, no daring you, to identify with the main character Joey, (Ethan Embry) who is a compulsive gambler and whose life is about to spin out of control. As you do, you experience a taste of that "unique rush of excitement" that a real gambler feels when they are up and are winning, but when luck runs out, the finality of what it means to lose hits home and the darker side of gambling emerges.<br /><br />Enter Tony (Christopher McDonald) a ruthless no non-sense loan shark. In my opinion, I thought McDonald delivered an award winning performance along with Bob Gunton (Nick) in showing the raw, gritty, and sadistic reality found on the losing side of the coin of gambling. Where gamblers gamble for the thrill and the rush, loan sharks are about greed. As you travel along at 200 mph with Joey in the fast-lane of a gambler's life, McDonald is the proverbial brick-wall-reality-check smiling sadistically back at you as you slam into him. A gripping performance was delivered also by Kathleen Robertson (Ali), who played Joey's wife giving us insight on what it is like being in love with someone who has a self-destructive addiction. <br /><br />My only criticism would be about the ending. I felt that this movie could have had any number of endings and it would have been alright, but it seemed like an ending couldn't be decide upon so they creatively worked them all in somehow. For me, it made the ending fuzzy and gray instead of a bold clear contrast which made the rest of the movie gripping and powerful.<br /><br />As an overall experience, I enjoyed watching the movie very much. It kept you constantly leaning forward in anticipation of what would happen next. If you enjoy fast-pace action-drama and character-driven stories, then highly recommend Player 5150 as it delivers.

Player 5150 is a gem of a film. It is a nice break from all those splashy special effects used nowadays to entertain audiences. This was a good character driven story about a degenerate gambler that pushes it too far. Anyone that has been involved with the rush of sports betting can relate to the plot and characters. Ethan Embry delivers a stand out performance lead role JOEY. His delivery combined with facial expressions made him seem like a true everyman caught up in a bad situation. I felt for the guy even though it was only a film. Kathleen Roberston was amazing. I only knew her from her days on Beverly Hills 90210.<br /><br />Bob Sapp makes a worthy cameo. Despite not being an actor he wasn't terrific or terrible. Overall I was entertained by Player 5150. Writer and Director David Michael O'Neil delivers a good film about the life of a gambler going out of control. If you enjoy character driven dramas give this one a chance.

Joey (Embry) has it all (good job, beautiful wife, good house, etc) including a gambling problem that effects everyone in his life.<br /><br />Some people have the travel gene  they need to go everywhere; some people have the gambling gene  they need to put something on the line..they get a rush they say. And, some people don't understand those that have the travel and/or the gambling gene. Seems to me that once one has seen almost everything one might get tired of the things one must do to do all that traveling. Apparently not. They still go here and there at the drop of a hat. <br /><br />And, one would also think that those who gamble and do not win as often as they would like would get the message that things are really not going to get better, and in fact they can get a lot worse. That's what this movie is all about.<br /><br />However, if you are going to make a movie about the pitfalls of gambling, don't make the ending all nice like it was all worth it. It really is not worth it, and may give some gamblers false hope that all will be okay later on. That's my only beef with this movie, otherwise it is extremely good.<br /><br />Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes

I have to admit that after reading the users comments from "adyt23" and another terrible review, I went into it without any great expectations and with my finger on the erase button as it was recorded on my PVR(Tivo in the U S). But boy am I glad I didn't erase it and ended up watching the movie!! I don't post many reviews on IMDb as I only post them when I'm am very pleasantly surprised by a movie as I was with this one. I really don't know how anybody could call this a bad movie. I thought it was one of the more memorable movies I've seen in the past few months or so and I highly recommend it. Their were some familiar faces so it was not just a bunch of unknowns in a low budget flick, it may not have had a big budget, but what it did with the finances it did have was put together a really good somewhat suspenseful type drama that involves bookies, gambling, a bit of drugs and all the ingredients that makes these "under the radar" or lesser known types of movies worth watching. The story is about a man played by Etan Embry, who has a serious gambling addiction and the ordeals he goes through to try and make good on his marriage. The events leading up to the final scene in the movie are riveting and I couldn't stop watching as it kept me glued to my seat the entire time. This movie is a hidden gem and as I said earlier, I highly recommend it and it is great from start to finish and boy what an ending it has. It really takes you for a loop but I'll leave it at that.

A charming romance for the first season and a half. The writing is superb and likeable actors made this a pleasant series to watch.<br /><br />Mary Page Keller in particular was magnificent to help make up for a wooden Matthew Laurance as the other lead. The supporting cast of Chris Lemmon and Alison LaPlaca are even better actors than the leads and Jody Thelen and Eileen Sorkin were effectively cartoonish contributors.<br /><br />The series takes a romantic stroll from Ben (Laurance) and Laura's (Keller) first meeting through the ups and downs of courtship. And this is a very delightful courtship indeed! Unfortunately near the end of the second season, the series veered completely away from the last sense of reality. Great stories and good laughs.<br /><br />I wish I could get this series on video. When will Nick or TVLand start airing this wonderful program? (Please!)

I saw this in Pittsburgh PA in a small theater there. This movie was a lot of fun with tons of B movie stars and references. A total blast from start to finish with everything you'd expect from a low budget movie. Brinke Stevens, Robert Z'Dar, Edwin Neal, and Tom Savini are especially good. This is by far the most fun I've had at the movies in years!

Duet was a wonderful program. It was cute without being sappy or saccharine. Who could forget their first date with a married couple in the middle of an argument? The cause of their argument was about family life. In the middle of it all, the dates try to compose themselves while the other couple are ready for combat at each other. They try to compose some normal conversation. In the end of their first date, the younger couple sit in the first seat while the older couple reunite the passion. It was all about passion and discovering one another. It was better than Mad about You then and is now. Duet was Fox's first show about relationships. I loved the casting of Alison LaPlaca and Chris Lemmon (Jack Lemmon's son) as the arguing couple. Jodi Thelen has a great role as Mary Page Keller's sister in the series. Mary Page Keller and her co-star Matthew/Mitchell Lawrence (They're identical twins and actors). Lawrence plays a struggling writer while Keller plays a caterer. They meet at a wedding of course in the first episode. They had a great opening segment. It's a shame that shows do not have the quality it once had like it did then.

Time Chasers features big chinned, Castleton graduate NICK MILLER (QUE elevator music) and his trusty textured wardrobe wearing friend-to-be-girl-friend LISA (QUE ... nothing). It also features the evil library clerk, CEO dressed J.K. Robertson. Oh yeah, it also has a guy wearing a pink shirt found at the day of the shoot cause he forgot his outfit. The storyline goes from a plane to a grocery store. Plus, a few shots of a plane flying into a camera that's recording a computer screen at the director's house on his off-day. That's all I should say, because the only interesting part was watching the credits to laugh at the fact that this movie actually had people to credit.

I love this movie.<br /><br />I mean, I know I only gave it a 1, but I love this movie.<br /><br />I gave it a "1" because I don't think that if you follow the textbook example of movies, this doesn't really work out. However, I think that if we consider different alternatives to what movies can be, then this is definitely something worth watching.<br /><br />It's kinda like a snapshot of the "old future", if you know what I mean. Well....no, you don't....but the thing is just filled with fun nostalgia and enjoyable situations. I'd love to see a sequel to this thing (and I hear one's in the works).

A good premise is wasted with bad dialog, wooden characters, and a hero that can't drive a car! It's true -- he commutes everywhere by bicycle. Our loser, err hero comes up with a time machine that runs off an old Apple IIe. He has to be fairly brilliant to have a time travelling program that can be condensed onto a couple of old 5 inch floppies!<br /><br />Our heroine is a newspaper reporter tricked into seeing the loser's invention with a story about a parachuting grandma. Later, when she discovers her own dead body, her reaction is as wooden as that of a cigar store Indian (or Al Gore, take your pick).<br /><br />The movie was shot in and around Rutland, Vermont. The local mall was used as the offices of the evil CEO, as well as the town's airport. At least the beautiful surroundings to take your mind off the bad movie. The Revolutionary War reenactors give the best performance.<br /><br />If you're an Alpha Geek who wants to find a way to get a woman, use this movie as your guide. Otherwise, forget it.

This is without a doubt the worst movie I have EVER seen (accept, I have yet to see Manos).Could the plot (if any) be any worse? They should have the scale be a zero on this movie, because I would rather put that instead of a one (because it doesn't even amount to a one).<br /><br />I think I probably have made my point pretty clear by now.<br /><br />Thank you.

Note: I've only seen the MST version of this film and the film's original trailer (which had a few extra scenes that were cut for time). Oh yea, and THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!<br /><br />There we go. Now, to whine and moan about this movie. It hurts a lot. The actors are untalented and unappealing, the music was synthesized with someones BUTT and the plot is full of holes. Argh!<br /><br />Where shall we begin? Nick Miller, alias Butt Chin (he could use some Chinderwear, pronto!) invents a time machine in a plane. Okay, cliched already, but maybe it could still manage, right? WRONG. See, he calls the newspaper and a corporation called GenCorp and gets them to look at it. Turns out that Butt Chin's old girlfriend, Lisa, alias Lady in Plaid (yowza, get her a new wardrobe!) works at the paper and so their romance heats up again. Yes, thrill at the sizzling hot grocery store scene! Of course, since this movie was made during the early 90's, GenCorp is an Evil Corporation and they've managed to destroy the future. The set for the evil J.K. Robertson's office is a laugh-it looks like it's in the skyway of a mall or the center of a library. And good old J.K. has a really, really bad New England accent. Thus, you can thrill at an insanely stupid chase scene. Thrill as Butt Chin, who crashes a car while escaping a GenCorp truck (Note: Where did J.K. manage to get such an army, anyway?), hops on a bike...and the people in the truck GET OUT OF THE TRUCK and chase him on bikes too, despite the fact it would be FASTER if they just kept driving. No, nobody thinks in this film. And much is to be made of the sorry attempt to show the Revolutionary War. If the movie is so concerned with tangents, than wouldn't they have created one when J.K. started blowing away tons of American minutemen? What if they killed someone who turned out to play a key role to the American victory? Yes, J.K. is indeed armed and dangerous. Apparently, ISO 9001 certification is a license to kill. And finally, we have the biggest annoyance of all...why did Butt Chin still pull that fast one on J.K. and get poor Matt fired when all he had to do was time-travel back to before he gave the demo and tell his past self to never give it? It would have saved himself some problems.<br /><br />Of course, this film can't stand enough to be painfully bad when it;'s being dramatic. It also tries to be "comedic", with such witty commentary as "What would MacGuyver do?" and "I never should have joined the Physics Club in high school." Ho ho. The "funniest" joke is, of course, involving the "sky diving grandmas."<br /><br />This movie hurt me. I want to go back in time and stop it from being made so I could undo the hurt it caused. Oh yea, and I also want to burn Lady in Plaid's wardrobe.

I've seen the MST3K version of this movie under the "Time Chasers" title, and I agree that it is NOT a good movie. In fact, it is barely watchable, and the leading man is not at all photogenic, and shows little-to-no charisma on film. He IS rather likable if you aren't looking for an Arnold or a Clint to carry your movie. I rather suspect with that strong chin and wedge shaped face that he is the type that looks much better in person than on film, which is the sad case for many otherwise decent actors.<br /><br />However, it hardly deserves to be in the Bottom 100, ranked below sludge like "Space Mutiny","The Creeping Terror", or "Escape 2000". It comes off as some would-be auteur's attempt to tell a story he'd been thinking about for years, and it has some heart and some honesty to it that are missing from many of the films on the "Bottom 100". It is ten times more competent than "House of 1000 Corpses" or any of Coleman Francis' work.<br /><br />The story attempts to be thought-provoking and amusing, sort of a sideways version of "The Man Who Folded Himself" or "And He Built A Crooked House", and no one in the film is as bad or corny as, say, the actors in "Werewolf" or Bo Derek in "Tarzan". What the movie is missing is good direction, or any real energy or compelling drive to hold the viewer's interest.<br /><br />So yes, the movie is dull and boring, but it lacks the sleaziness, or contempt for its audience, or sheer incompetence that mark so many movies on the list.

This disillusioning tale of time travel is more popularly known as Time Chasers. It is a tale of good vs evil, plaid vs pink and chin vs CEO. You'll laugh, you'll cry...but mostly you'll just cry.<br /><br />As a standalone, without MST, this film is still one of the funniest things American cinema has left in a steaming pile on the sidewalk. The only moments that don't induce side-splitting laughter are the moments when our be-chinned hero makes an attempt at a joke. Then you just rub your temples and moan.<br /><br />As for the cast, it's well-rounded on both sides. Our good guys consist of butt-chinned Nick Miller, the scientist cum action star who delights us with his hockey hair, frightens us with his strange face and tempts us with his partial nudity. The heroine, Lisa Henson, is apparently played by a robot. She displays no tinge of emotion so I can only assume the automaton in her role was not yet advanced enough to out-act the Commodore 64 in Nick's plane. Our comic relief is the broken down cousin of Bruce Springsteen. He's constantly asleep or spilling coffee, sometimes multitasking by doing both at the same time. Jim Carrey eat your heart out.<br /><br />As for the bad guys, this is where the fun lies. A short fat man in a pink jacket just screams pure evil. He's the unwitting sidekick of the true mastermind from hell. Yes, J.K. Robertson is the epitome of villainy. His strange accent makes him not only hard to understand, but hard to take seriously. The muscle of Evil Co. is the assistant janitor who pounds the hell out of our hero before his girlfriend saves him with a gutter down pipe.<br /><br />As for the plot, it's almost as befuddling as the mere spectacle of Nick's chin. Nick invents a time traveling plane and puts his science busting work onto 8 floppy disks. He proceeds to hand over his life's work to the CEO of a fortune 500 company for an undisclosed amount of money. According to Robertson, breaking the time barrier is worth "millions". Bill Gates made more by stealing the graphic user interface from Xerox. Wow, I think Nick got low-balled.<br /><br />Back on track, Nick heads to the future, a bleak future where kids wear lime green tights and talk on an amazing invention known as the mobile cellular phone. Crazy. J.K. soon heads to the future with HIS new plane, where he somehow manages to single handedly cause the apocalypse. And you thought Y2K was bad. In a series of events, Nick and J.K fly back and forth through time trying to do something. Exactly what they are trying to do is beyond our imagination and beyond the budget of this film, so we never really find out.<br /><br />In the end, the most horrible thing possible happens and we end up with 2 Nicks. God help us all.<br /><br />Aside from a cameo by Noah Emmerich driving a cab and speaking like a mongoloid, the acting is either non-existent (Lisa) or overdone to the point of inducing nausea (Nick). I can't consciously recommend this film to anyone without the MST crew commenting. It gave me the trots.<br /><br />Without MST this stinker gets a VERY generous 2/10, with MST it is my single favorite episode and pulls out a 9/10.

All right, enough with the MST3K-ing, people. I of course saw this movie through the show, and I thought their treatment of it was hilarious. It's one of my favorite episodes. Surprisingly enough though, unlike many other movies ridiculed by Mike and the bots, this one is far from bad. Maybe it's just the sheer number of times that I've seen it that has made it grow on me like some kind of low-budget lichen.<br /><br />Of course the acting is sub-par and at times could wilt flowers on the side of the road. I wouldn't expect stellar performances from a collection of actors coming out of rural Vermont. The whole time travel concept involving a small engine aircraft is laughable I'll admit. The portrayal of the future is hardly better than a shot of a present day main-street strip. There are a number of minor holes in the plot, one of which involves how Nick managed to get a gun after falling into a lake out of the plane. Another would be the way that the future was unaltered even though automatic weapons and the wreckage of a plane/time machine were left in Revolutionary War-era America.<br /><br />Honestly though, I believe that these shortcomings were inevitable given the budgetary constraints of the film. The film was cut and edited well, which are aspects I believe to be important in a film of any budget. Take a look at the shoddy editing in some films with budgets over 100 million dollars and it's almost shameful by comparison. Corny by mainstream Hollywood standards, I believe that this film should be viewed for what it is: an impressive achievement by an unknown low-budget filmmaker. I think we should be asking ourselves, given a camera and a few thousand dollars to make a movie about time travel, "could we have done better?"

And then filmed during each actors day off at their actual paying jobs? I have to wonder if each actor has a copy and if they crack it open every time they have company over to share in the pride that they once were in an actual movie. I am sure they meant well. I am positive that this movie was meant to be thrown into a well and drowned before someone had the brilliant idea to show the entire world a movie so badly created that a scene that depicts the actual time period that they "chased" to had to shown via dates on coins. High-Tech stuff. And why is it that every time that a "INTO THE FUTURE" movie is made...does anyone not die before they get to that point in time? My copy of this movie may come in handy during my future. I may need to level my dryer with it or I might use it as a coaster for a pitcher of beer as I enjoy watching the MST3k version of it. Huzzah!

I got a screener of this film a couple of weeks ago. Before I watched it I checked out this site and instantly began to dread watching it. I finally gave up last night and threw it in. What were these other reviewers watching? Is it the same film? One mentions he thought the movie, called ZOMBIEGEDDON for Christ's sake, might be a film festival flick. I'm wondering now if this person needed glasses to read the title. Do movies with cheesy titles usually go to film festivals? If so, which one so I can go! Then there's one saying that they weren't warned like they are with a John Waters film...um, did you see the warning at the beginning of the film? Or listen to Uwe Boll in the opening? It makes me think some of these reviews are fake. One of the best zombie movies? Nooo, not even the positive ones seem like they've seen it. What you do get here is a real weird ass zombie film, if you can even call it a zombie film. After the warnings on how bad it is from Uwe Boll and retard doctors (I'm serious) you get Brinke Stevens humping Tom Savini. You get in on the tail end of the sex and then some brief nudity and a few cute one liners from Savini. Then Savini is gone. Perhaps my biggest beef with the film is the in and out cameos. The people I want to see more of only have brief scenes and then there's those that annoy me to no end that we have to see for the whole film. I suppose that's how you get a great crap cast though...After the sex, Brinke goes to her job at the radio station and is provoked into telling how all of mankind will be dead in so many hours. The movie then goes into all these different and sometimes intersecting stories that add up to a bunch of Z grade actors getting killed by zombies. I have to admit it and definitely hate to, but I kind of liked this film. It's guaranteed to get trashed, as it is on this site but there's something offbeat and weird about this film that makes me love it. Maybe it's the cameos from people I love or the pure ballsiness to seemingly not care what people are going to think of the film, like when they gave it such a cheeseball title (probably not expecting people to confuse it with art-house fare like one reviewer did). I found myself smiling through most of the film. That doesn't happen very often. I laughed out loud two or three times and a few more times at the horrible delivery of some of the actors but I'd be shocked if 80's B movie fans didn't enjoy this film if they're willing to accept it for what it is. It's a movie that obviously had no budget, hopefully made by young people. If it's by young people then this movie is OK. If the makers of this film have been around for a while you should probably stop. What sold me on the movie is just the weirdness of it. I really don't have any other way to put it. The actors are crap, the movie looks like good digital, there's nothing special about the way it's filmed or edited, the make up is probably good for no budget but not for something with a budget so all this movie ends up having going for it is it's weirdness. Luckily, it's one weird arse movie.

Hey, it's not a time machine, it's a "time transport"! I don't care what they call it, it's still powered by a Comodore 64. I own a watch with more features and memory. Oh well, I still like this movie. It's no masterpiece and it doesn't pretend to be. It's funny(maybe unintentionally). I've seen it with and without Mike and the 'bots and it's fun either way. Nick Miller, played by Matthew Bruch, has little or none of the qualities generally associated with a hero. He's weak. His humor falls flat, and that chin. WOW!! I think it has it's own SSN. He is good at getting beaten down though, which happens in this movie a lot. His love interest is kind of pretty, kind of Julie from the Love Boatesque. <br /><br />I must say that I admire the spirit that an independent film like this shows. A different subject might have been better on a limited budget. However, that being said, I think David Giancola showed some promise here. I hear he was 23 when he made this. I recall my occupation involving the culinary artistry of making and delivering pizzas when I was that age. I guess he has my act beat.<br /><br />I recommend this film. Like I said it won't remind you of Back to the future(unless you see the cleverly placed poster in the movie) but you will laugh at and with it.<br /><br />For Castleton!!!!!!!

This backyard movie has it all: time travel, a heroic cleft chin, an evil corporation, and stocky men in pink suits. The plot revolves around a man who builds a time machine out of a Cessna. He seems like a pretty normal, loser-like guy, so he obviously won't be too concerned time traveling "in style" with a DeLorean like some charmingly eccentric mad scientist (well, he actually has no choice, he can't drive). He takes a reporter and a pink suit man along for a ride into TV static and, ultimately, the future.<br /><br />"The Future" really has almost nothing special in its appearance, other than a food court, which actually looks pretty normal. The closest thing to a special effect is a sign on a building claiming that it was built entirely out of recycled material. When the evil corporation takes over the time machine and does some vaguely bad thing with it (it is suggested that some futuristic was brought into the present), Our hero finds out that the "future" has turned into a local slum populated by a few hobos with guns (not lasers or anything just normal guns). How cyberpunk.<br /><br />The movie continues with our hero trying to stop said corporation, romancing the girl, "engulfing her" with his chin-butt, getting unpresentably filthy on many occasions, doing irreparable damage to the space-time continuum, dying while unpresentably filthy, and allowing his alternate temporal self to continue this tradition. A showdown occurs between him and the evil CEO during the American Revolution with a Turtledovesque twist an anachronistic Uzi. The movie ends happily with him getting the girl and averting the whole situation.<br /><br />The movie has a so-bad-it's-good quality that most older bad movies have, whereas new bad movies are just unwatchable. MST3K does a great sendup of it as well. The movie has its strengths such as some humor (especially in the shockingly accurate insight to a loser's lifestyle). It is also disturbingly prophetic in its vision of a future populated by kids who go everywhere with a cell-phone glued to their heads, oblivious to their surroundings.

It was a true labor to sit through this "movie". I believe after the MST3K folks scraped the bottom of the barrel to find films like "Manos: The Hands Of Fate", and "Mitchell", they took a peek under the barrel to find this piece of drivel lurking underneath. Basically a hair-helmeted, bespectacled nerd builds a time machine out of his airplane and old Commodore computer, and decides to sell it to some evil guy of some evil company. Wackiness and pain ensue. View at your own risk.

The comments already posted for this film do not do it justice. It is a very low budget sci-fi film made by lesser known people and should be judged that way. To say the film shouldn't be made is plain wrong. How do people learn without doing? Small pictures should be encouraged, not made fun of just because they are not of the highest quality.

One of the funnier MST3K experiments. This was an ambitious film, light years ahead of Manos and Hobgoblins. they simply couldn't afford the talent or special effects for it. In terms of effort they get a 7/10. Almost as funny as Space Mutiny. I give this one a 3/10 because there was a passable plot, and some half-decent acting. The funniest part for me is when the wormy fat guy is in the plane with his evil boss and Crow cracks: "Sir, I'm getting a little worried about lunch, it's almost 12:30" or something like that. This one was fun to watch, even though it is strictly fodder for the folks at Best Brains.

Time Chasers is probably one of the better movies on MST3K, though the competition isn't too tough. There was actually a pretty complex plot, but it had been done before in Back to the Future. The so-called hero wasn't very likeable (couldn't even drive a car), and the bad guys screwed around, making them not very threatening. It didn't have much for special effects and it could have really used them. The MST3K was great, and it was fun to watch the movie because it was filmed in Rutland, Vermont. I give it a 4/10.

... to dull the incredible pain this stinkmaster causes. You really have to feel sorry for Lisa Kurdow in this film. The film's makers picked her to be in a small, uncredited cameo role. Instead of making her the lead, they chose Bonnie Pritchard. Why is beyond me. Probably the only person who can act in this entire film is Lisa. There are plot holes big enough to park the Titanic inside. The plot goes like this: A geek that has loser written all over him invents a time machine (and why in the world was he using Commodore C64 computers anyway? Did IBM & Apple wisely tell these people not to use their products? For 1994, those computers would have been about 10 years old.) He takes a reporter (Pritchard) back and forth in time, then also a swarmy businessman. The businessman copies the time machine, and starts reeking havoc on the timestream. Therefore, the inventor has to go back in time and tell himself not to show the invention to the businessman. But something I didn't understand: if you go back in time to prevent yourself from doing something, how would you know to go back in time to do it? In the end, I cheered when both inventor and businessman died in the Revolutionary war era. <br /><br />This film was produced by Peter Beckworth. He also gave us Moving Targets, a film that combines the talents of Burt Ward, Miles O'Keefe, and Linnea Quigley. It was filmed completely in Vermont, and it shows why there are no major cities in that state. Avoid this one unless you're watching the MST3K version.

I feel badly for the actors and directors of this film who may come across this site's comments about it, which was fairly well done - for a low-budget film.<br /><br />All the criticisms about the film are true: The evil CEO's office in an apparent library, the antique computer with outdated floppys, and the fairly wooden acting are all valid criticisms. But what do we expect, Spielberg? Lucas? I'm sure they could have taken this film to greater heights, but let's give it its due.<br /><br />Think about it. The plotline was clever. How many ways can you go into the past? Car, stationary machine, plane? But the "future" portrayed here was embarrassing. Frankly, I thought they had gone BACK in time to 1984! Surely, they could have done better than that. Even in 1994, people knew what types of technologies to expect in the near future. Why not portray even one laptop?<br /><br />I enjoyed the revolutionary war re-enactors, but I think a "twist" of an ending would have been cute, and could have salvaged some of the film. What if, when they returned, everyone had BRITISH accents, including the evil CEO of a now-British conglomerate. Think about it.<br /><br />So, here's my "director's cut" of this film: 1. Allow the lead actor to drive a car (better chase scenes) 2. Use a real computer - at least use the right sized disks 3. Cut the "ditching bicycles" scene (it's only 3 seconds long) 4. Show a better, more plausible future 5. Shorten the "bad future" scene, and shoot it at night, or in the fog, to make it look REALLY ominous, and 6. Make the final scene important (as I said above).<br /><br />Until then, my rating is 4.

I'm not really sure they were trying to make a good film. There was a lot of material that really helped weaken this film that could have been edited out, and wasn't. It's almost as if the director, or the producer was making a film simply to have a bunch of friends appear on camera and was afraid to take out very poor scenes when their removal would have strengthened this film. Still and all, it wouldn't have been a good movie.

****SPOILERS****SPOILERS****SPOILERS****SPOILERS****<br /><br />You've been warned. Okay, I can't stress this enough but the 'hero's' chin really does focus your attention on him rather than what masquerades as a plot. The hero, Nick Miller, a college physics professor, invents a time machine on his Cessna using a Commodore 64 (yeah, you had one too right?). He, stupidly, sells his invention to the local evil corporation headed by the initialed JK Robertson (NOT to be confused with JK Rowling of Harry Potter fame, of course). Said evil corp duplicates the technology and proceeds to usher in Apocalypse in the year 2041. Big-chinned hero and reporter girlfriend try to change the future and in a series of events too painful (and not horribly important, though including one version of girlfriend Lisa getting killed and a duplicate Nick coming into the picture) to recount, they along with JK, flunky Pink Boy and garage mechanic end up in 1777 Vermont. Blah, blah, blah...<br /><br />One of the blaring flaws is them messing with history. JK kills his Michael Medved looking flunky in 1777 with an Uzi and the body is left there. The group freely mixes with the Red Coats and the Revolutionaries at that time without either side making notable comments about these strange looking people. And somehow, after all this interaction, the future from that point wasn't affected by the fact that these differently dressed people with strange accents that came down from the sky in a flying bird. Riiiight. You could see where, with talented writers and editors WITH eyes in sockets, this could've been a decent film. Big budgets aren't always needed. Thank the heavens for MST3K! I miss you!

At the beginning we can see members of Troma team company and Uwe Boll says " This is bad, it's a big s***, don't watch it, don't even think about it, stay away from this movie", now we are warn...<br /><br />But they are wrong, the film is brilliant. OK it have a lot bad things like : no budget (of course), no good acting, no fancy FX, no good location, no good editing, no good sound.....etc In fact, in all technical aspect, the film is bad, but that's not a surprise. But when you watch Zombiegeddon a lot of this disappear or make the film pretty funny. And that's the power of this movie, the film is fun, good fun. Because it's not an annoying and boring movie, no that's more a good horror/comedy, between "shawn of the dead" and "an Ed Wood movie". And that's really enjoying to see a movie like that make you smile at least 75% of the time. The movie is really cool. Great Troma movie !

This is a really dumb movie, with a very low budget, and because of that, this is a very entertaining film.<br /><br />Nick is a nerdy, bike riding teacher, who has built a little plane into a time machine. He sells his idea to JK, an evil guy from the government. Meanwhile, Nick is falling in love with his old friend from school, now reporter Lisa. The movie's low budgetness might be what makes it enjoyable. You actually get an intimate feel of the characters and their cheap surroundings. With that said, this is a terribly written and directed film. Whenever Nick goes back in time, it looks like he's going into television static. The acting is just terrible, and everyone seems like they're reading off of cue cards. The ending of the movie takes place in 1777, and leads to one of the dumbest climaxes ever.<br /><br />This is a genuinely bad movie, but it's not without it's charm.<br /><br />My rating: * 1/2 out of ****.

Nick Miller has developed a means of time travel using a computer and his small airplane. Needing the funds to continue his experiments, he agrees to sell his invention to a large corporation named GenCorp. But Nick hadn't planned on how GenCorp would use his time machine. On his next trip to the future, he discovers a world in chaos where social order has broken down. Nick decides he must go into the past if he is to restore the future.<br /><br />Like most people on this sight, I came by Time Chasers courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. And while the movie is bad, it's not as bad as a lot of the stuff they showed. Oh, it's got the usual bad acting, a dorky lead, poor special effects, some ridiculous locations (Others have mentioned it, but I've got to agree with the slamming of J.K. Robertson's office. The mezzanine of the local public library isn't a very effective or realistic looking location.), giant plot holes, and everything else you find in your typical, run-of-the-mill bad movie, but it's got something I wasn't expecting to find. It's actually got some good ideas buried under the rubbish. The whole notion of time travel, changing the future, and going into the past to make things right is a good, interesting concept. Unfortunately for the makers of this movie, I think their ideas far exceeded both their abilities and certainly their budget. It's too bad, because as I indicated, there are some good ideas to be found in Time Chasers.<br /><br />The MST3K treatment of Time Chasers is good  actually, it's very good. The first time I saw it, I found myself laughing out loud. So, while I give the movie a 3/10, I'll give it a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.

That's what the director of this film had to be saying throughout it's making The story is set around Nick, a geeky teacher at Castleton college who invents a time machine using eight commador floppy disks and his plane. After Superdweeb sells his time machine to Bob Evil he discovers the FUTURE has been harmed. Will he be able to prevent the future for being ruined? Will he end up with Lisa? Will anyone really care?<br /><br />The answer to the third question is...NO!! This film is horrid and so many flaws I'm lost. How in the world to the past self who is the present self know his future self who was really the present self know JK took him to 1777? With all the deaths they caused to the minutemen, shouldn't that have caused a time rip or something? Where did that gun come from on the fishing boat? What about the flying grandma? Shouldn't pilots pay attention to the sky? What was the point of making this film? And if it was for college, did they fail?<br /><br />1/10 Why no zero available???

Think of this one as Back to the Future...except not very good.<br /><br />The use of time travel and possible timelines gone askew does nothing to add to the film. Our lead guy is a David Koresh look-alike, but a lot less evil. I think he was trying to do justice to physics teachers who do aviation on the side, but have no time for grocery shopping. There's a romance angle here, but it's not really important. Characters meet themselves in other times and it gets really confusing like where did he get that gun after he jumped from the plane into the lake?? You have incompetent security guards and a CEO with a really funny accent (even funnier acting). There's a lot of running, biking, flying, and a really cool car stunt that took 4 takes. Due to limited budget, the future, past, and present look pretty bad which makes it more funny. Hey, if Lisa Kudrow is in this (even for a few milliseconds), it's worth checking out for kicks.<br /><br />"Food courts of the future!"

What happened to the 'second' hero who went back to 1777? Didnt the soldiers of 1777 document the 1st use of an UZI? Wouldnt a PLANE CRASH FROM 1777 BE NEWS??? The girl who 'died' in the plane crash didnt find it unusually shocking that she FOUND HER OWN DEAD BODY IN THE PLANE CRASH?? My god, this script must have been written over a lunch meeting with the producers. Awful, and just flat out stupid. 1 star because of the JFK Dollar from 2041.

Tangents (better known to MST3K watchers as Time Chasers) is a prime example of pure MST3K fodder. Made on a shoestring budget by a small production company, it's a by-the-numbers example of a small-budget film with big-budget aspirations.<br /><br />The plot itself is a fairly interesting take on well-treaded territory: the hero, Nick, invents a way to make his ultra-light plane travel through time and sells the idea to a CEO, only to later discover that the CEO is going to use it for, you guessed it, evil.<br /><br />The excecution of the plot, however, suffers from a number of handicaps. The portrayal of the future (both the utopian and apocalyptic ones) is laughable at best with the former looking like an 80s shopping mall and the latter a bad Warriors knockoff. The main characters are all boringly average (causing Crow to dub the film "The Adventures of the Average People" in the MST3K episode), the only one having anything identifiably unique about them being the main character, Nick, whose only unique traits are "building a time machine" and "not being able to drive a car" (setting the stage for an absolutely ridiculous bicycle chase scene). If anything, the film reminds us that probably the only Vermont export of note is Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream (who, coincidentally, provided ice cream for the filming of this movie).<br /><br />All in all, Tangents falls in the same general category of MST3Ked films as Overdrawn at the Memory Bank; a small budget film that is ridiculous enough on its own merits to make it a decent watch for lovers of pure cheese (though, as always, I recommend watching the MST3K version instead).

Time Chasers joins various films that have been given the razzing they deserve on MST. A little more competent than most films that are shown, it's still pretty bad. A bike riding scientist invents a time travel device and puts it in his Cessna. Why not a car? Well, he can't drive and I doubt he can get going fast enough on his ten speed. Like the lunkhead he is, he tells an evil corporation (is there any other kind?) about his invention and they take over the project. There's also some kind of lovestory too and our butt chinned hero takes his plaid clashing girlfriend to shopping malls of the future and to the fifties! Pretty soon there's two lunk heads running around and they go back to 1777. Why? I just don't know and I really don't care. The question that still bugs me is, where did that gun come from?

Delightfully awful! Made by David Giancola, a guy who I've long forgiven for this travesty. The man "gets it", and he has the humility and humor to laugh at a very early effort.<br /><br />Most filmmakers might have the good sense to forget about their early work. Not David, on the contrary he celebrates this movie. What is really needed here is a 'special edition' DVD, with outtakes and commentary. <br /><br />Seriously, it's amazing what can be made with a little imagination, a lot of 'can do' spirit, an investment in your own community and your good friends. Giancola was in his teens/early 20's; how many people can watch and laugh with a film they made themselves at an age before most of us moved out of the house? <br /><br />Bravo,David and Edgewood Studios.

Watching Time Chasers, it obvious that it was made by a bunch of friends. Maybe they were sitting around one day in film school and said, "Hey, let's pool our money together and make a really bad movie!" Or something like that. What ever they said, they still ended up making a really bad movie--dull story, bad script, lame acting, poor cinematography, bottom of the barrel stock music, etc. All corners were cut, except the one that would have prevented this film's release. Life's like that.
